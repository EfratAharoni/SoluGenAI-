https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,1/22/2022,All I can say is they have very good ice cream I would for sure recommend their cookies and creme ice cream it is very good
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,4,6/26/2022,Nice little local place for ice cream.My favorite is their pumpkin shake ( Fall season special).( My Sweetness tolerance is low) Their LARGE SIZE ice cream usually seems too sweet after having ice cream for a while. But love their pina colada. So refreshing. Their Banana Split is good too.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,8/7/2021,A delicious treat on a hot day! Staff was very friendly and helpful-- gave us a sample and let us order a little earlier than open.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,4,7/28/2016,"This was great service and a fun crew! I got the banana cream pie with chocolate ice cream. I loved the flavor of this. It had freshly cut bananas, graham crackers and chocolate ice cream. YUM!! The only thing that I noticed is that it melted pretty fast and it's a bit icy. I like creamier ice cream (so it had a bit more overrun that I prefer), but overall, was delicious!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,6/23/2015,"This is one of my favorite places to get ice cream in the CU area. It's a bit of drive, but it is worth it. It's about 10 minutes from the far side of Urbana. Getting there is really easy. The atmosphere of the Dairy Barn is very kid friendly. There are many tables set up so that you can sit and enjoy the ice cream. When my friends and I went, the line was about a 20 minute wait, but it didn't seem like any time at all. An older gentlemen, I presume the manager or owner, was giving out samples to the entire line. You could tell that he took pride in the product he made and was excited to share it with everyone. The special that night was cappuccino ice cream. I added in cookie dough to make a ""tornado"" which is a blizzard like ice cream treat. It was so quite refreshing and was a nice treat on a humid night. The Dairy barn is a must go!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,5/1/2019,"I've been coming to this ice cream stand since I was a little girl back in the 1970's. (Yes, it's been here for that long! Just not under the same ownership.) But not much has changed in those years in regards to their basic ice cream. It is a great family place! They are always accommodating when we want to tweak the menu item a bit :-) I love the rotating, special flavor of the week! Keep an eye on the Facebook page for that. It's always a joy to see the near constant long line. Shows how successful a small town business can be. If you are truly passionate about supporting small business, stay away from those franchises that make their ice cream at some corporate factory and come get some made fresh soft serve from your truly local business!!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,1,8/11/2016,"The soft-serve is way too sweet and has a strange Splenda-like aftertaste. The flavors tasted very artificial, and I ended up with a stomach ache when I got home... I really don't recommend this place, your simple Baskin Robbins is much better."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,11/5/2016,My husband and I stopped here on the way back to Monticello from Westville (Go Sages!). He had a chocolate shake and I had a cookie dough tornado. Both were very tasty and refreshing. What a cute place filled with character. The service was very friendly and efficient. I love small town gems like this!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,8/19/2015,"Little piece of heaven, the best ice cream shop near Champaign Urbana. Decent prices, superb taste; What else do you need on a hot summer day! This place is cash only, and sometimes you can smell cow dung. Other than that, this place serves far better ice cream than neighboring ice cream parlors (like Jarlings) of Champaign-Urbana."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,2,7/26/2019,"Went here for the 1st time tonight. I ordered a turtle tornado. It was excellent. TONS of pecans and lots of flavor. I guess I could be picky and say that it melted incredibly fast. Too bad my wife and son didn't have the same experience. My son ordered a plain chocolate cone. My wife ordered a vanilla cone w/ a chocolate dip. I tasted both, after they said theirs didn't taste very good. I totally agreed. Both were very watery in flavor. My sons had a bit of an icy consistency. Instead of ice cream or custard - they resembled ice milk. Not going back. Jarling's Custard Cup is way, way better."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,4,3/30/2015,"Our bike club comes here often year round for evening ice cream cycling excursions from Champaign-Urbana. The staff is always VERY friendly and accommodating. The ice cream is tasty, although I do prefer the fattier taste of custard. All in all, a wonderful place to visit."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,5/18/2018,Best ice cream in the area! I love their featured flavor of the week! The staff is always very friendly and the service is generally pretty fast!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,5/5/2018,Delicious ice cream. Best soft serve I've ever had in my entire life. Staff is wonderful and friendly and even though they only have a few flavors it will leave you in a wonderful happy place and life will be good.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,3,9/4/2014,"Local Dairy Barn that served your typical traditional American dairy products. The ice cream was itself was so rich that I could taste the milk. If you just simply want an ice cream or something simple, this is definitely a good place to go. But personally I see nothing too special about the place. There's ample amount of parking in their private lot, but expect there to always be full of locals populating the area. When in doubt, just make your own parking spot. I know I did"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,7/22/2016,The best soft serve hands down...no further explanation needed!! Every flavor...those that are constant or those that change weekly...LOVE. THE. BEST.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,7/6/2016,Best home made style ice cream. I stop by any time I am near Sidney and make special trips from my home 13 miles away from time to time.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,7/6/2016,"Definitely have to check out their facebook for the flavor of the week! We were there for coffee flavored and it was delicious. I have to go back to check out the lemon, as I have heard wonderful things about it. Definitely worth the drive if you're looking for something different than custard"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,6/25/2016,"Much better than Champaign's Jarlings. Better service, better ice cream, and the lines usually significantly shorter. Worth the drive!!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,11/1/2016,Basically the best thing since sliced bread. Definitely worth the trip outside of Champaign!!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,6/18/2013,"I LOVE the Dairy Barn. 20 minutes east of CU, this is the picture perfect small town ice cream place. Outdoor, order at the window and sit on the picnic tables under the festive outdoor lighting to enjoy your soft serve treats. Chocolate and vanilla always available, with a rotating special third flavor (I love mint week!). There are always special tornadoes (think blizzard) to match the flavor of the week. I also recommend the raspberry truffle tornado; raspberry flavored ice cream with magic shell-like dipping chocolate mixed in. If you want a short journey and some awesome ice cream, go to Sidney Dairy Barn! Update: I love Dairy Barn. It should have 5 stars. What's my problem?"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,4/12/2013,"This is still the best soft serve I know, in the world. My favorite flavors are mint and cherry. Their flavors are subtle, mild, and the cream is not overly sweet. Lately, the ice cream I've had at other ice cream establishments has been so sweet that it's actually inspired this positive review. I once finished a quart of Sidney Dairy Barn ice cream, in an afternoon, by myself. At other places I'll only have a small cup and I'll feel sick and renounce ice cream for a month -- how depressing. I don't know what else they do differently, but the milk is fresh and the flavors are right. It's basically a stand in the middle of corn fields - at last that's how I remember it - and they're only open during the summer. I always go out of my way to come to Sidney Dairy Barn and it's always a trip worth taking. P.S. CASH or CHECK only."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,1/21/2016,"This place is the bomb, and absolutely the kind of place that makes it worth searching around for the best local joints on a road trip. We spotted it on a hiking trip and made a stop on our way out, and it was flat-out amazing, as you could probably guess based on the long lines stretching out at dusk. The service was incredibly efficient for such a tiny joint, and they had a good selection of flavors; but the food was the real attraction, amazing ice cream desserts made from that fresh country cream that you can taste the minute it hits your tongue. It's also got 1970s prices, which makes the massive sugar rush all the more worthwhile."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,2,9/5/2015,"Ice cream is good but the service could be improved. I rarely get what I actually order. A peanut butter cup tornado with chocolate ice cream isn't that hard to understand or make. They just lack attention to detail. First they made me a m&m tornado with chocolate ice cream and when I told them it was supposed to be peanut butter cup, I got a peanut butter cup with vanilla ice cream. This didn't happen just once either. My order is wrong more times than it is right! I'll just start telling them to surprise me since I always am when I go here."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,6/26/2016,"GREAT ice cream! It's a frequent trip for us from St. Joe. Don't be surprised by long lines, but they have a good routine and send the orders out very timely. You can't compare it to Jarlings, as that is frozen custard, but it's still very tasty. I like that the Facebook page posts their flavor of the week. Hope they stay around a long time!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,5/9/2014,Great little ice cream stand in Sidney. Delicious and inexpensive and excellent service from friendly staff! I highly recommend a stop and you too will be hooked!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/sidney-dairy-barn-sidney,5,8/17/2011,"A local favorite! Very worth the drive, they are more than happy to make you whatever you can dream up! Like most soft-serve/custard places, they serve their regular flavors and a flavor of the week. Creme de mint is so tasty! But so are the fruity flavors. You can also catch the Moo-mobile at the Urbana Farmer's Market and other local events. I like their ice cream sandwiches but when I visit the Sidney location, only a chocolate dipped cone will do!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,4/20/2022,"Pro-tip: Definitely give the rotating ice cream flavors a try - they offer samples! The double scoop is worth the money if you're sharing with someone. Highlights: The female workers the night we went were super nice and so honest with their opinions about the ice cream flavors. They let us sample a few of them and then gave us the biggest double scoop! For sure worth $6. The ice cream itself was insanely good, very creamy, rich, and actually better than a ton of ice cream shops in the area. Lowlights: Some of the ice cream flavors on the menu weren't actually available which was a little disappointing."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,7/18/2022,"After seeing some positive reviews about Rewind, I wanted to stop by and check it out for myself. A store that sells boba and ice cream at the same time? Say less and hook me up because I'm coming over at the speed of light. Now onto the review: Dessert/Drink (3/5): For the drink, I got a Blueberry Matcha Latte and I got the Matcha Madness (in a cone) for dessert. Let's start with the drink. As someone who absolutely loves matcha, I knew I had to order this. It is different from most matcha drinks I typically see in which this one comes with blueberry puree. The drink was a good size for what the price was; however, the drink isn't that spectacular. The matcha flavor was nice but the blueberry didn't really add any wow factor to the drink. If anything, I felt as if I couldn't ever taste the blueberry so that was rather disappointing. The Matcha Madness ice cream included the following toppings: two pocky sticks and chocolate shavings. I find that the ice cream itself was pretty smooth and had a really good matcha flavor to it. Only downside was that it was really melty within a minute and the ice cream wasn't as pretty/have a nice swirling effect. Atmosphere (5/5): The establishment was really pretty and I absolutely love the vibe. Decor was pretty minimal but any place that has a neon sign and a grass wall is amazing in my eyes haha. The store was also very clean and neat. Seating was pretty limited as there was only 4 - 5 tables. Service (4/5): Service was alright. I didn't find it to special or felt that workers went out of their way. Did notice that a worker was talking to their buddies when people were waiting to order. Overall, just lack of attention to customers; however, the drink and ice cream came out at a good pace. Overall, Rewind offers customers a good mixture of drinks and ice cream selection to satisfy any sweet cravings. The attention to customer could be improved but timing between order and handout was good. Would I come back? If I was in the area then maybe, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to go. Might only get ice cream if I go though as the drink was average."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,7/13/2022,I got the special! Orange creamsicle flavored soft serve. Comes topped w orange gummy bears. It tasted like orange sherbet that was shaped like soft serve. Defo not like an orange creamsicle. For $8.5 i feel like there should have been more richness or icecream-likeness. If I wanted orange sherbet I would go to walmart. I'll be trying one of their original blends next time.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,2,7/12/2022,This was the longest wait I've had for an ice cream cone. Also the most I've paid for one. Almost 10$ for an ice cream cone. Nothing to write home about. This was a miss for me
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,2,7/12/2022,"I used to looove this place (hence my previous 5 star review), but the last few times it's been so beyond lacking in service. I don't know if it's what I've been ordering or what, but it takes forever! And I don't think a shake at an ice cream place is crazy. People will get served way before and I've had to ask if my stuff is going to come out. When you ask it's like a lightbulb comes on and they realize they forgot your items. I asked for two scoops of ice cream the first time and that took 25 minutes to get (after asking about it). This most recent time was a mint chocolate chip ""bowl"" (which came out timely but melted all over my jeans and car by the end of it because they couldn't give me a lid) and a strawberry shortcake shake (which took crazy long to produce). I love this place, but I have no idea what is happening."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/22/2022,"Great spot to drop by after a long day of volleyball and a good dinner. Convenient that they have boba drinks, ice cream, shakes, etc - something to please everybody! The girls opted for a Taro Milk Tea and the Butterfly Strawberry Lemonade - both with boba. I chose the Chocolate Crumble Ice Cream cone. Everybody was happy with their choices & enjoyed the late night refreshment. If you haven't tried it out & your in the Tempe area, give it a shot & see what you think!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,12/22/2021,Nicely decorated spot for sweets and drinks! Good place to catch up with people or a quick stop to treat yourself. Got Vietnamese Coffee and Tiramisu ice cream and we LOVE the Vietnamese coffee! So good and strong with coffee flavor. Matcha Immuni-Tea: matcha was light but good if you like green tea. Butterfly Rose Lemonade: pretty and a refreshing drink. Would recommend!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,7/11/2022,The rose milk tea latte is my wife's favorite in AZ. I enjoy their immunity-teas. Haven't had an item I didn't like yet. Plenty of parking and seating at this location. The ice cream looks great too but I don't have much of a sweet tooth to try. Looks like you can get it mixed with your favorite cereal.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/3/2021,"Rewind has a trendy look, but the beauty isn't just skin deep. This is my go to boba place when I'm in Chandler. Layered drinks like the rose milk latte aren't just eye-catching on Instagram-- they're also delicious! I've tried their milk tea and their fruity tea, and they do both well. I would definitely bring anyone here, because they serve things like ice cream and can please people who don't like/aren't willing to try boba. It's also a little cheaper than some other boba places around here. Every time I've been here, the staff have been exceptionally nice. That, coupled with how quickly they make drinks, is what really makes them a five star establishment in my eyes. They also have a good variety of flavors, including non dairy and caffeine free choices, and the ability to customize sugar levels. Someday I'll get ice cream here, but their tea is so good that I haven't been able to not order it!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,11/12/2021,"Came here for boba and hmm... their drinks look so cute and all that, but I had thai milk tea with boba and the tea was ok but the boba was undercooked. I feel like even when the tea taste good, if boba is hard and undercooked, I tend to feel that drink isn't good, and I guess that was the case. Although, I came here for ice cream one time, and their ice cream was pretty flavorful, they have some of the very unique flavors, I think I had Vietnamese coffee flavored ice cream and it was pretty good! Probably I'll come back here for the ice cream but not for boba!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,11/1/2020,"I scrolled through Google to find the closest Boba place and found Rewind. It was so worth the 15 minutes! I LOVED EVERYTHING I ORDERED. The staff was so kind and friendly, the atmosphere was so calming. A good place to sit down and enjoy your boba. The decor is so aesthetically pleasing. It was so delicious, I almost cried it was gone. The rose milk latte was so fresh and sweet which is how I love my boba. I also tried the house coffee with rose cream (not pictured) was so good and refreshing. It was Literal perfection! I cannot wait to come back!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,11/24/2021,This ice cream was exceptionally good. I would so come back here next time I'm in PHX. Think of getting soft serve ice cream mixed in with you favorite cereal... this is the place to go!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,3/19/2022,"I love coming here. It's the first boba place I went to after moving to the valley. Their customer service is amazing, everyone is super kind every time. They have so many options. Delicious locally made ice cream with vegan options! The establishment is always clean and picture ready. There's not enough nice things to be said about Rewind."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,6/2/2021,This place was delicious! They had lots of vegan options. I didn't know vegan ice cream could taste like the real deal. They also had lots of options of non vegan ice cream as well. You can taste test them if you'd like. It's a little pricier but worth it!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,2/3/2022,Great service! Not your average ice cream stop but work a stop to try something different. Fun choices for kids and adults
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,8/23/2020,"Craving some bubble tea? Be kind, visit Rewind! This shop is in the same plaza as Pokitrition, Culver's and Firehouse Subs so you can can get some food in addition to drinks and dessert if you so desire. The menu has a plethora of ice cream and bubble tea options. I opted for the brown sugar milk tea, mountain green immuni-T and a lychee peach green tea. I enjoyed every drink! The brown sugar milk tea had a good balance of sweetness + creaminess and had a hint of caramel undertone in it. I wanted it with boba but unfortunately it would have taken 30 minutes for them to make it. I personally think if you're a bubble tea shop you should always have boba ready and waiting for the customer during business hours, especially if the only mix in options for your drinks are boba or crystal boba. The immuni-T was filled with fresh ginger, lemon and honey. It was cool and refreshing with a bit of a kick to it from the ginger. I also enjoyed the lychee peach green tea, a delicate tasting and lightly sweetened drink. Service was good and I was happy with the sweetness amounts the bobarista recommended for each drink. I'll be back to try more if I'm in the area."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,12/29/2021,"There is a lot of variety at Rewind, from soft serve with mix-ins, various sweet tea concoctions, and scoop ice cream. I tried a vanilla swirl with Reese's peanut butter cups mixed in - kind of like a Blizzard at DQ, with banana slices on top. The ice cream was quite sweet. The presentation was nice with bananas strategically placed. It was very soft and started melting over my cup almost immediately even though it was a cold day so prepare to start eating right away."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,10/10/2020,"GREAT LOOKING ICE CREAM Went right up to the counter to order. There are many yummy sounding ice cream combinations but I got the Minion's Treat. I also decided to get the Thai Tea Crush. There were a lot of people that ordered before me but everyone's ice cream came out in a timely manner. The ice cream gets blended with your choice of mix-ins. Personally I thought there was not enough mixed in as not every bite was flavorful. Even though every bite was not packed with bananas and Frosted Flakes, it was still good. The Thai Tea Crush was good but a bit watery for me. Overall, try it out if you want a cold instagramable looking treat."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,3/20/2022,This spot is definitely in my top 5 for Thai tea. I ordered my Thai tea at 50% sweetness and I'm happy I did because their boba was surprisingly pretty sweet which was a great surprise. Probably some of the best boba I've had. Thai tea had great flavor. My only complaint was the cashier taking the order. When we were ready to order he just looked at us and didn't say a word. Not sure what his deal was but he needs some more training on customer service. Gotta stop by here if you like Thai tea though.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,8/16/2020,"Dropped by Rewind on a weekday and was not disappointed in the least! I love strawberry matcha drinks and was so used to being able to find them all over the Bay. However, I hadn't really found a good place to grab one in AZ. I ordered the strawberry matcha with boba at 75% sweetness. First off, the boba was great! It had the perfect chewiness and was sweet without being overly sugary. Definitely a plus point here. The drink itself was good though the strawberry was a bit more artificial than I liked. It also was not as rich as I am used to so that was the only tiny critique I had. Overall, this place is cute and the drinks are delicious. Service is friendly as well. I will definitely be back to try other menu items including the ice cream which looked scrumptious! In regards to Covid, it was great to see everyone wearing masks. There is seating outside with spaced tables if you would like to brave the heat and sip your drinks before heading home. Parking is quite easy within the complex so you can attempt to drink your tea in the car instead of melting as well."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,3/1/2021,This is a very popular place. There was a lot of foot traffic in and out which was a good sign. They have a simple menu and easy to understand. Ambiance inside was nice and bright. Seating is limited. There is outdoor seating but very limited as well. The staff were great. They explained the menu what the new flavors were and the wait time for everything. They provide samples if needed and the amount of ice cream is a good amount. The shakes are great even the coconut I was great in place of vanilla. It would be good to have more flavors available for the shakes. There are a good amount of choices for the boba. Looking forward to coming
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,1,6/4/2022,Absolutely awful experience!! It was hair in my ice cream and the manager was super rude about it and said they don't give refunds!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,1/12/2021,"Rewind is a matcha specialty cafe which I was really excited to try. I have been here for both ice cream and boba drinks. They have both soft serve and hard scoop artisanal varieties. I ordered the Matcha Madness soft serve which came with chocolate shavings and picky sticks. I found the matcha flavor to be bland unfortunately. The hard scoop ice creams are not available in matcha flavor. On to the drinks, I ordered the strawberry matcha latte at the recommended 75% sweetness. The matcha flavoring was quite prominent, I was very happy with my choice. I would like to try the Matcha Americano next. I also had the Butterfly Strawberry Lemonade. Its colors were so beautiful I hesitated to mix it up but alas, must move forward. This drink is pretty unique in that none of the flavors are distinctive. If someone handed me the drink I would not have guessed it contained strawberries or lemons. It was a little too sweet for me at 75%, I would order 50% next time."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,4/7/2022,"The bobas were chewy and hard. They could keep the kitchen area cleaner and better stocked. One of the staff members was polite and another was expressive in a not-polite way. I asked if they sold like tubs of ice creams with toppings (If they did I wanted to take four multiple folks). In my mind, they could say no which the polite one said. But the other one looked annoyed. Use questions as a way to enhance customer experience. They have a lot of room to improve."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,3/8/2021,"So happy my brother and sister-in-law sent over a little surprise from Rewind. Now I have this place on my list. Drinks were super yummy. The Thai tea was delicious and is always a good drink to default on when you're having a hard time choosing from all the other milk teas. I'll have to stop in to see the rest of the menu but I'm confident that they'll be just as good as the three that were delivered. Also, their quality does not lack as you can see from the photos. The drinks traveled well."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,4/20/2020,"One of my favorite local ice cream spot! They always shave delicious drinks, boba and coffee. My personal favorite order is the: vanilla ice cream infused with fruity pebbles and I usually add boba as a topping in a cup. Sometimes they get confused if you ask for boba as a topping, but ask for it in a cup and it should be ok! The brown sugar milk tea and rose milk tea latte are my go to drinks. Their butterfly rose lemonade is pretty good too! Very refreshing and perfect for Instagram pictures. They also have so many different matcha drinks!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,7/3/2021,"Been in AZ for 3 weeks now and have been impressed by all the tea shops around! From Rewind I went bold and got the matcha coffee, which I usually don't get when I go to tea shops that have them! Also went with a safe jasmine milk tea. The Jasmine milk tea at 50% sugar was perfect for my husband and I, whereas the matcha coffee at 50% sugar was too sweet. Will probably get 25% sweetness for that one next time but overall this place was really good!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,6/15/2021,"Came here a few days ago with my s/o after ordering a brown sugar milk tea (50% sweet) with boba and a coffee crush online. Unfortunately, they were out of regular boba by the time we arrived, so I ended up with aloe vera. The tea itself was great and aromatic, but the aloe vera didn't pair well (not Rewind's fault, just a bad choice that I made!) I found the coffee crush altogether too sweet, but my s/o liked it fine. One thing to note is that the online ordering is a little buggy--I had originally wanted to order a Thai Tea w/ boba, but the online ordering didn't give me the option of adding boba to the thai tea. Would recommend ordering at the store instead of online, which also would prevent you from ordering something that isn't available. (If I had known they were out of black boba, we would have gone elsewhere) Overall, service was a little slow, but otherwise a cute store with friendly staff and tasty drinks."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,2,7/2/2022,"Let me say, I usually love this place. My negative review is that I've driven to their location and ordered through app and my favorite item is on the website and online order form and it's not something they claim to carry except seasonally. If you don't want to carry Pineapple Express year round, please remove it from your Chandler location menu."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,11/13/2020,"My husband and I were on our way home from grocery pickup and decided to get a quick treat from Rewind. After much deliberation, I decided on the Rose Milk Latte and my husband ordered the Hojicha Latte. The employees were friendly and speedy in getting our drinks made and out to us, especially appreciated during these times! My Rose Milk Latte was as expected; definitely had a subtle Rose flavor and at 75% sweet, was a good amount of sweetness ... I only ordered the smaller size last time, but would probably get the large next time. I had gotten my drink with the crystal boba which was pretty difficult to find. Not sure what the normal amount is but the quantity I received left me wishing there was more. The Hojicha Latte had a very distinct flavor, almost earthy. Probably would not get this one again but this drink had much more boba than mine. Overall, a cute litte spot. They have a variety of tea drinks, ice creams, shakes, and so on. More like a 3.50 star review for this experience but rounding up to 4."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/6/2018,"This place is so good! I love an ice cream place where you can customize your flavor and Dripps does that to perfection! The best part of it is they use cereal flavors blended into the ice cream and then you can add toppings to add to the delicious ice cream you created. I got the Captain Crunch Berries ice cream blend with gummy bears. Perfectly creamy ice cream that tastes freshly made with just the right amount of cereal flavors throughout the ice cream. The best part is they have a wide choices of cereals from frosted flakes to Apple Jack's to name a few. We also tried out a few of teas like the Matcha and the Rose tea. Both are delicious, not too sweet and very Instagramable looking! It's a must to add boba to the drink. Good here to get your treats on cause this place is one of the best in Arizona!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,6/18/2021,"If you are a fan of watching Saturday morning cartoons and eating a big bowl of cereal, this place is for you! The menu is full of many fun options with their ice cream-cereal concoctions. Unfortunately, this place just wasn't for me. The combination of ice cream and cereal was fun but overall nothing special. I would probably return to try again to see if I can find something more to my liking. The place is very Instagramable tho! Note: I have only tried the ice cream, cannot speak to any other menu items."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/17/2019,"YES YES YES! This place was so good. I had heard about it from a news article because of they way the ""drill"" the ice cream to mix and serve it. We went and I got an ice cream with cinnamon toast mixed in and brownie bites on top. My friends got milkshakes. It was all super tasty and delicious. I felt the portion size to price was affordable for the milkshake but I felt the price was a bit high for the amount of ice cream you got; although it was really tasty. My only complaint about this place, although it would only stop me if there were really long lines, was that the service was kind of slow. After ordering it took about 10 to 15 minutes to get our ice cream and two shakes. There was only one person before us that came in. The people who came in after us had to wait a few minutes before their order was taken. Again, it would not stop me from coming back and the flavor was really good but the wait time, I felt, is an area for improvement and maybe would push me away if there were long lines."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/18/2019,I was really impressed with my whole experience at Rewind! The employees greeted me with kindness and did a fantastic job in explaining the items on their menu. I ordered the matcha ice cream and it turned out to be very delicious. I also love the setting inside where you can get some pretty cool pictures. I wish more ice cream spots shared the same energy as the folks from Rewind do. I'll be coming back for more!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/29/2019,I'm impressed! Only had their drinks but both times it was very delicious. Had the matcha strawberry and pink crush. Decent prices and quality drinks!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,10/29/2019,i'm a fan! i stopped here for a quick dessert date with a girlfriend of mine and we both got one drink and one ice cream creation each! i decided to create my own using their vanilla base with fruity pebbles mixed in and topped with more fruity pebbles. it was soooo good. it was dense and creamy - loved that the ice cream didn't start to melt right away too. I also tried their Pink Cloud drink and presentation-wise it was 5/5. Unfortunately I didn't try it before my ice cream so I couldn't get the true flavor or taste of the drink. :( that just means i'll need to come back though! Would def recommend if you're in the area.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,1,9/3/2020,"both times I've been, their boba is cooking and won't be done for about 30mins. What is the point in offering boba tea when your boba isn't ready ever. Maybe start making the boba before you open? Giving up on this place."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,5/6/2020,Rewind has super delicious drinks. I tried the sweet matcha with crystal boba (they ran out of black boba sadly) and it tasted just like it's from Japan! Staff was friendly and I can't wait to go back to try more of their yummy creations!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,2/14/2021,It's Valentines Day and me without a Valentine decided to treat myself with a big ol' ice cream cone. Not something I do often so this is big. I walk in and there's about 4 people waiting (6 ft apart) and the folks behind the counter were hoofing it! Their fabulous creations went quickly by and I give my order after a little wait. Hand made is worth a small wait. I've been here for tea though this time my Minions Favorite ice cream cone blew my socks off. Frosted Flakes in little pieces inside my ice cream groovy! You gotta try this place. I live in the neighborhood and supporting small businesses is a priority for me. I'll keep coming back because they're worth it!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,5/9/2020,Pretty fast service for this COVID19 situation w limited workers. The employees are super friendly and they have plenty of disinfectants when you walk in. Clean environment and the boba is amazing like always. Any matcha drinks and the brown sugar boba are amazing. I also appreciate the milk substitutes available.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,12/15/2018,"Weekend of firsts! Happened into this place because we tried the sushi burrito place in the same strip mall. Young lady explained the options so went with Minion's Treat (ice cream, Frosted Flakes, banana)...so good! Frosted Flakes are mixed into the ice cream along with banana. Whole think mixed together and topped with more flakes and few banana slices. Talk about decadent in a cup! Wife had the Thunder Buddies (Reese's Puff, banana mixed in and topped with almond slices, bananas and Teddy Grahams). So yummy and fun concept!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,12/3/2019,"I came here for the second time last week for bubble tea. The first time I visited, my brother and I came in to try the cereal-infused ice cream I had read about. I had ordered the Thunder Buddies and he ordered a Cookies and Cream shake. I'm not going to lie, I wanted to steal his milkshake after trying it!! Both visits, the staff was very quick to greet me and will offer to explain the menu if you haven't been there before. This time there was a girl working behind the counter and I asked her about the Brown Sugar Milk Tea sweetness. She had a sample that she was able to offer me and indicated that she could make it more or less sweet. The sample was the perfect amount of sweet! I went ahead and order that with boba added. I'm definitely a fan and would come back and try it again!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,1/7/2021,This place has great boba tea however they are always out of boba. I have gone many times all the way down to chandler to only find out they have no more :/. Still a great place!

https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,11/3/2021,"We usually come to this place to eat ice cream. Their ice cream is so good, it doesn't have egg smell like other ice creams."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,8/21/2019,"My dilemma coming here is always if I should get ice cream or a drink (and should I get that drink with boba). Today I got ice cream with cocoa krispies (its blended into the ice cream- yummy and unique), topped with graham crackers and honey drizzle - so good! Perfect for hot day too. My husband got the Cookies & Cream which he really enjoyed. The staff here is friendly and helpful when it comes to giving suggestions. This has definitely turned into one of my favorite dessert spots. I look forward to coming back and maybe trying a drink next time."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,2/16/2020,"Absolutely great sweet matcha latte here. I will be coming here constantly. They have a rewards program as well. Boyfriend got the banana butterfinger vanilla cone and he likes his as well (he's pretty picky, glad they didn't mess up his ice cream ). Good customer service as well! Thank you guys!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,11/14/2018,"I'm a big fan of Oreos and when given the chance, will mix that into my ice cream 9 times out of 10. This is hands down my favorite place for Oreo ice cream. Dripps does it different. You can choose a cereal or cookie and they will crush it into the ice cream in the shop. What you end up with is this thick, creamy concoction of your favorite mix in + ice cream that stays true to taste! I've tried their ice cream and a few of their drinks and liked it all!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,7/12/2019,"So aesthetic and delicious ice cream! My boyfriend and I shared the cookies and cream ice cream in a cup and it was very good. My second time going I got the vegan coconut ice cream so people who are dairy free like me can also enjoy! I got the coconut ice cream as a base, Oreos as my mix in, and cookie dough as my topping and it tasted SO GOOD. I recommend getting things in a cone because it seems you get more for your money"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,8/28/2021,Delicious vegan ice cream and drinks are so aesthetically pleasing! The interior is cute and great place to just hangout.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,2/19/2021,Visited from Cali- it's the only boba place I went to in AZ and I miss it! Really wish they had one here too
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/5/2020,"I'd like to start off by saying I've been here 3 times in the past week. Each time, I got a different drink and each one was excellent. The service has been great, all the people I've seen working have been kind and it's very clean and cutely decorated inside! The vegan options are awesome and I'm so happy that a lot of their popular drinks are dairy free by default without having to ask. I love floral flavors like lavender and rose, so their rose milk latte is amazing and their honey lavender ice cream is PERFECT, Most places never put ENOUGH lavender into things, but this had great flavor. I've brought my wife and also recommended to my coworkers, we all work up the road. Please consider coming to Gilbert/Mesa so I can enjoy closer to home!!! Love this place."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/25/2020,"I have been meaning to try Rewind after realizing how close it was to Pokitrition. They serve boba and ice cream (have to go back for the ice cream!) but the boba I had was amazing. Against my better judgement, I had a blended boba tea rather than my usual milk tea. I got the Brown Sugar Crush. Absolutely delicious. VERY sweet, but delicious nonetheless. If you have a sweet tooth, this might be the drink for you. In addition to boba it has custard at the bottom of the drink, which I normally get as an additional add-on. Will be going back for sure! Gotta try that ice cream next!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,7/31/2021,Not a great experience. They had been open for over an hour and their vanilla ice cream still wasn't hardened so none of their menu creations were available. The music was so loud we had to repeat our order several times. I did like the lavender ice cream but only a couple bites of it were bursting with flavor--the rest were a bit bland even with the cereal.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,6/26/2021,"I've tried the boba tea here a couple times and it just isn't my favorite. The flavors sound like they'd be very good, but they didn't taste as good as they sounded. I have some friends who went and really enjoyed it, so it could just be me. Their desserts and drinks here are really pretty and make for nice photos, but the flavor wasn't there for me."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,3/16/2019,"Okay I am Dripps regular now and I have to go with 5 stars. Be it their ice cream or tea they are incredible. Not only do they boast of Instagram worthy pics but they are unbeatable in the taste wise too. They are sisters from Pokitrition and must say they know what works. Eat at Pokitrition and get 20% off at dripps. I have tried their thunder, Oreo, minions icecreams and each one is different from the other and totally good. Their rose milk latte is my fav, the Flavors are so good and it's definitely for the rose lovers. Overall a must place, though their price range is over the top, it's definitely worth it."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,1/21/2020,"Well - they don't scrimp on the toppings like DQ has been doing lately. I drove by here when I missed my turn into the Whole Foods parking lot and decided that I needed to go in and check out the ""craft"" soft serve ice cream. Especially when I read so many good reviews from other yelpers. I don't normally get a milkshake when I get ice cream, as they are so quick and easy to drink that they don't last long enough for me. But I decided to get one here as the pictures I saw made them look soooo good. I went with Oreo as my topping and chocolate ice cream. I saw the clerk put a huge scoop of ice cream in the drill machine with a big pile of Oreo cookie crumbles and some milk, and it looked like I would be eating for days. But after it was all blended, it went into a 12 or 16 ounce cup with an inch on the top for her add even more Oreo chunks, so there was not a lot of shake. It would have been great if she had given me the sidecar like you get in the metal containers at diners rather than just throw out the yummy leftovers. And I never thought I would say this, but it was just too much Oreo for me. I also think I missed out on the yumminess of the high fat ice cream experience that everyone talks about by having it put into a milkshake. Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll get an ice cream cone, maybe with Reese's mixed in."

https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,10/13/2018,"I had tried this whole cereal mixed with ice cream craze in LA a few months back and was so stoked to see it pop up in AZ! I'm a fan of boba and my girlfriend loves cereal and ice cream so we were excited to check it out. The best of both worlds. The shop is new - really cute and definitely hit the mark when it comes to an instagrammable vibe. Neon sign on the wall, pretty drinks, ice cream with toppings, they know what they're doing. I saw lots of photos being taken. Service was incredibly friendly. We were asked if it was our first time and given a quick rundown of both menus: the ice cream and the tea/drinks. I went with a 16oz milk tea and added boba ($.50). My girlfriend got captain crunch ice cream in a cone topped with strawberry and sprinkles. The milk tea was average and the boba was solid. It was a little too sweet for my taste. Other places will let you pick your sweetness flavor.. didn't get the option here but maybe you just have to ask? It wasn't bad but I'd probably stick to ice cream next time if I'm going to get a lot of sweetness anyways. That's just my personal preference though! They have some really pretty signature drinks (rose milk tea, some type of lemonade) so there are other options on that front. The ice cream flavor was spot on and really tasty. You get a large portion of ice cream so don't be afraid to share, and don't feel bad if you can't finish. There were a couple larger chunks of cereal on the ice cream that tasted a little stale but overall it was quite the treat. We will definitely be back again after they have been open a little longer to try more items."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/22/2020,Love love love! I can't believe I never popped in before! The hostess was super nice and gave us a lot of info on everything! We got the minions treat and it was superb. I wasn't sure if I'd like the cereal topping but surprisingly it tasted really good with the ice cream. I'm definitely going to return!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,8/10/2020,"YUM! I went when they offered a BOGO free scoop of their ice cream. It was delicious! If you've ever been to Carmela in LA, I would say this is very similar and better than Salt and Straw. You can taste the yumminess and real flavors. Wasn't too creamy or lacking in flavor. Just perfect combination. They are allowing you to sample so I ended up choosing lavender and raspberry chocolate truffle. Delish! Girls working were super nice and helpful though they seemed a bit overwhelmed by the customers coming in and didn't have their groove exactly down. The place is small and cute and has seating inside and outside. There's a bathroom in the back. Lots of parking and other places to eat in same plaza. I wouldn't mind going back. Its only $4 a scoop so not bad on pricing either. Also, great customer service cuz when I got my ice cream I saw what looked like a hair but wasn't exactly sure so I asked the girls and they weren't sure but offered to remake right away which I thought was really great service:)"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,2,9/27/2020,"Watch out people. First they don't honor your Yelp freebies AND they have an attitude AND the vegan coconut ice cream tastes like sugar water. No flavor at all. AND it's EXPENSIVE EXPENSIVE EXPENSIVE. The young lady taking my order, must have been in a place where she couldn't hear what I ordered. I looked at the menu board and thought I ordered a cup with one scoop of ice cream and another cup with two scoops of ice cream. I also had a free topping. She distinctly told me that chocolate chips could not be ""swirled ""in. I had no idea what she was talking about. I said OK put the chocolate chips on the side; that's OK for me. She shook her head yes. I ordered two scoops of ice cream for my other half. And we were supposed to get another free topping with our Yelp Check-in. Then she rang up my bill at $15.86. I thought well four dollars for one scoop and six dollars for two scoops... How does that equal $15.86? I showed the cashier the bill and she re-rang it up as $11.86. Another little girl from behind the counter came up, looked at my receipt and just said: ""Nooooooooooo...."" while shaking her head. I was still confused but I went ahead and went with it. I found out later (from watching and listening to other customers ordering) what they do is they take the topping and mix it in through some machine and charge a whole lot more money for that. But how was I supposed to know that was my first time there. My advice is ask questions before ordering. Especially if it's your first time; because nothing was explained to us and it was our first time. I personally will never come back here. To me a customer and their service to a customer should come first. I believe we were treated unfairly and to eat ice cream in such an environment where I am treated this way does not feel respectful or comforting which is the whole idea of going for ice cream to me"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,7/25/2019,One of my fav dessert places. Really cute and chic Staff is always friendly Love all the ice cream options My fav drink is most definitely the matcha strawberry latte.. sooooo goood !
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,3/21/2020,"So I'm a matcha green tea fan and it's so hard to find around here! But little did I know that there's this place hidden in the cuts of chandler, REWIND! It's one of the only places that has a huge variety of matcha infused drinks!! I drive 22 minutes just to have a taste! Can't wait til they open up another location in Scottsdale!!! La Vida Matcha!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,2/20/2021,"Rewind, what in the world happened?? This used to be my absolutely favorite place for ice cream because of the authenticity of the matcha. What happened to your quality of matcha ice cream?? This is absolutely unacceptable. I can't remember the girl's name but she was one that helped established the place and she knew how to make matcha. She remembers me and regardless of what I order, she always has it down to the T. Her drinks were right, her ice cream, everything. Every passing time that I have come by here from late 2020, I haven't seen her. And every one of those time, the matcha ice cream quality has been..well.. sh*t. Hopefully the photos are in order but you can see from the course of 2 years how the quality has gone down each time. It was great at first then it dwindled to crap. Time by time the ice cream becomes more and more powdery rather than blended. This last time I had actual powder at the bottom of the cone and broken all over my pants. How is this matcha ice cream? And the color of the ice cream was extremely distorted. White and green all over. And there are actual chunks of unblended matcha power that are suspiciously oxidate like it's old matcha. You can tell by the color and the taste. This is so disappointing. I have scout out every boba and matcha place in the Phoenix and surrounding area. Please don't ruin your reputation by your newer employees not knowing how to make matcha ice cream. I won't be coming back. I'm sorry, too many disappointed times."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/31/2021,Loved this place. I had the milk rose latte with coconut milk. They do different percentages of sugar! Also can't wait to go back and get their brown sugar test
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/28/2021,"Love that they have vegan options! Seriously some delicious and unique flavors, awesome toppings, and a wide array of sugary treats that could fit anyone's needs."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,4/12/2019,I'm from the Bay Area and my parents just moved to the area. This place popped up and all the drinks and ice cream desserts looked so good! I ordered the Strawberry Matcha Latte and my boyfriend ordered the Butterfly Rose Lemonade. It was pretty packed on a Sunday Night at 7 pm. The staff was very friendly. This place is so cute! Modern and Chic Decor. Definitely a lot of photo ops lol The Strawberry Matcha Latte was delicious and aesthetically pleasing. It tasted just as good and identical as Boba Guys back home. I tried my boyfriends Butterfly Rose Lemonade and it was very refreshing as well. I'm not a fan of Rose flavored items but the Lemonade definitely overpowered the hint of Rose. I'd definitely come back. Everything just looks so appetizing and pretty.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,5/29/2021,Fun place to try different flavor combos. We had chocoholic and frooty tooty and loved both. Waffle cones are fresh and yummy as well. Service is great!! Very clean.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/1/2018,"Dripps is a deeeelight! Ever since I saw their sign go up with the words soft serve + tea, I've been so excited and anxiously waiting for them to launch. I was hoping they would specialize in Asian drink teas and boba as we don't have anything like that in this particular corner of Chandler, and to my pleasant surprise, they do! I popped by during their grand opening night where they were offering Buy One Get One on all ice cream and drinks. It was a bit of a wait but well worth it. I decided to get two drinks to try, and it was so hard choosing as ALL the drinks sound and look amazing. Got the Strawberry Matcha latte and Rose Milk Tea. Both so good, with the Rose Milk Tea being floral and sweet (best when mixed) and the Strawberry Matcha having delicious fresh strawberry purÃ©e at the bottom. Can't wait to try their other concoctions like Matcha Cold Brew and Roasted Green Tea Hojicha latte! Their decor is *aesthetic* af and there are plenty of spots to get a good snap of your pretty drinks and cones. I especially love the tropical wallpaper and hexagonal marble tile in their kitchen area!! So pretty. Can't wait to come back and try the soft serve - I saw on insta that they have extended their BOGO deal for a few more days (show that you're following them on social media to redeem!) so I might have to go back and get a cone! (Summer's over and so is my theoretical summer bod lol)"

My ice cream was good but the other one we ordered was not and I ordered a Thai tea with boba(my favorite drink) ans had to throw it away. It was not good at all. Tasted watered down was tart nothing like my normal place. I'll stick to my normal place down the street. It looks so good in the pictures and on reviews and did not live up to the hype at all

I don't know what it is but im addicted to the shakes here, I tried replicating my favorite shake at home (the strawberry shortcake one) and man it just wasn't the same I don't even mind though because paying for the shakes here is definitely worth it"

https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,10/30/2018,"The Iced Matcha Latte was what caught my attention. Unfortunately, there is only one size for that particular drink 16 oz. Hint, hint make 24 oz available for coffee/matcha lovers like me! They also have ice cream with a variety of cereal and toppings you can blending into your ice cream. I haven't had a change to try it yet. Looks interesting, but I am more of a sweet drink person. Cute decor in the shop an friendly staff."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,9/27/2020,"The ice cream was a great experience. The customer service was NOT! Daily ice cream flavors rotate. I got a double scoop ice cream in a bowl. The flavors were: Thai Iced tea and vegan vanilla topped with coconut flakes. The flavors were subtle but satisfying. My companion got vegan coconut with chocolate chips. We both checked in with the Yelp app. We were to get a free topping. We both showed our app and it was clicked used. When all was said and done, one of the yelp check in was not honored. When we approached the cashier said she couldn't honor both- the bill was over $15. We found her rude and condescending. She should have said that at the time she nodded at both check ins. While the ice cream is great- its not worth the price when there are soooo many choices in the area. If the cashier would have been kind, it might have been worth coming back. You would think owners would be more cognizant of who they hire to be the first face customers meet. And since people of recognition are treated this way- apparently the power of word of mouth referrals goes unnoticed."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,12/15/2020,"Best. Boba. In the area. I moved here from the OC which has the best boba on the west coast, don't @ me. So I searched a whole YEAR to find a decent boba place and I had settled... UNTIL I DISCOVERED REWIND. Their menu is small but everything is soooo good. The drinks are delicious and aesthetically pleasing. They have ice cream too which looks delicious and they have a really cute cereal concept, but I hardly ever veer away from my usual Matcha with Strawberry boba (10/10 recommend) They let you choose your sweetness level too, which is a huge plus. I've tried the Thai Tea, Rose Tea, and Brown Sugar and they're all delicious. The only thing is that they're usually understaffed and getting your drinks takes a while which can suuuuck especially with COVID, but it's still 5 stars for me."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,1/20/2020,"What a fun place for ice cream!!! I've been here twice already and have sampled quite a few items since I bring my kids here each time. While most places have a variety of combo-ice creams, this place has become a major hub of cereal-infused goodness. Great location situated on the SWC of Ray Rd and the 101. And housed near Poketrition, Firehouse Subs and Culver's. This is a great spot to add a sweet option to this area. We typically stick to their signature items on their menu. Each signature item gives you the option of having it served in a cone, cup or milkshake style. We have done all 3, and really.....it depends what you prefer because they are all SO good!!! My favorite item has been ""Thunder Buddy"". Such a fun name to begin with if you are a ""Ted"" fan, but also the ice cream combo is so tasty if you are a peanut butter and banana fan. They have an excellent variety of cereals to choose from if you'd like to create your own cone or milkshake, plus every topping you can imagine. Their menu also boasts a large variety of milk and bubble teas. I haven't tried them yet, but since their menu is so extensive, it may take me a while to try one. Prices are typical for this kind of treat. We usually pay $7 for their signature ice cream combos. Totally worth it when you see how much you get. They are very generous with the infused ingredients as well as the toppings. If you are a fan of places that are insta-worthy, this is one of them. They have a cute vined wall with neon lights for pics as well as some fun tropical wallpaper surrounding the interior. Fun place to visit with friends or to take kids. Looking forward to trying more items off their menu."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,4/12/2020,The drinks here are so creative and so good! I love the ice cream here as well because the mix ins are crunched up and goes great with the ice cream! I love the butterfly rose lemonade but everything I've gotten from here has been pretty great! I love that they're open right now with everything going on! And they provide hand sanitizer AND sanitizer wipes! A little on the pricey side for the drinks but worth it!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,8/28/2019,"WARNING - Part of this is a copy and paste of the caption from my food insta (which, btw, you should follow me on it's @blairs.eats lol) I am from Tucson but often drive up to Tempe for school related things and I loooooveeee to eat, especially since there's not a ton of variety in Tuctown! I went to Rewind because I'm almost always craving boba and it's the only thing I'm willing to branch out of my comfort zone on. I couldn't decide what I wanted so I got two drinks! The strawberry matcha latte and rose milk latte. They're both sooo good and amazing! Not like what we have in Tucson but I'm not knocking either. The matcha is refreshing with a citrusy kick thanks to the strawberry and the rose surprisingly, actually tastes like rose! 10/10 would drive 100+ miles again. I'll definitely come back again when I'm in Tempe again!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/1/2018,"We absolutely love this place! I would drive across town for them! I adore the idea of my favorite cereal in a soft served! The concept is very unique for a dessert shop in Arizona! When it comes to their drinks... their Butterfly Lemonade is my favorite! Very refreshing and light! Honestly, I don't know what some of these people are talking about when they say their customer service is bad. I never had a bad experience here and the staff have all been very friendly to us."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/16/2018,"Came here during their soft opening and the ice cream is absolutely delicious. You choose a mix-in (various cereals) which gets blended into a vanilla ice cream base and then gets topped with your choice of toppings. The texture is soft and creamy and the blended mix-ins weren't too chunky or gritty. We chose cinnamon toast crunch, which added a lot of flavor to the ice cream itself. I tried a couple of my friends' drinks and they were all aesthetically pleasing (basically, Instagrammable). The teas were quite strong and floral, so if that's not your thing I would skip them. The inside is really well decorated and the ice cream and drinks came out pretty quickly given they're probably still learning some things on the fly. I'll definitely be back often as it's probably some of the best ice cream I've had in the East valley. Like their sister shop (Pokitrition), I can see this place maintaining their high quality and introducing some exciting things in the future."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,11/14/2020,Oooohhh. THIS place is so very good. I love ice creams especially a rootbeer float. I did not go here for rootbeer floats but the ice cream is the best. The pumpkin pie ice cream is the best I ever had. You get what you pay for and you are definitely paying for a great tasting awesome ice cream. My new favorite ice cream spot!!!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,4/15/2021,"I came into this evening for some ice cream and i ended up adding the Butterfly coconut to my scoop of Bourbon ice cream. The ice cream had an amazing unique flacor, and the butterfly coconut was beautiful to look at and it tasted really good for a coconut lover. They have a lot of vegan flavors and options. Ill be back."

https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,3/5/2020,"Presentation is good and interior of this place is cute but flavor wise, matcha icecream and brown sugar boba were both pretty average. The premium matcha did not meet up to my expectations and the boba was subpar. Hence why 3.5/5"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/28/2019,"Super happy to have finally given this place a try. I went to a very similar shop in NYC & was only hoping for this take on ice cream to spread. I got Frosted Flakes ice cream topped with snickers & teddy grams--soooo good! I was nervous the Frosted Flakes would be really sweet, but it wasn't too much at all. Honestly some of my favorite ice cream now--everyone should try it!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/20/2021,"The aesthetic there is great! So cozy and modern. They have a variety of Teas to choose from. Also you can choose how sweet you want it and I think that's great if you want your tea less sweet. The price for the Tea is great. I get Thai tea with boba and that's under 5 dollars. I've tried the Thai, brown sugar, and chai. Personally chai isn't my favorite but my bf really liked it. But the Brown sugar and Thai were really good and yummy! Overall a really great place to get Boba Tea from and you cannot go wrong with the prices there."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,12/3/2020,"Great place, nice atmosphere, and friendly staff. They offer a great assortment of teas and coffees as well as vegan ice cream which is a nice change!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,2/22/2022,Their boba is best!! Just right. Not too melt or not too hard. And Ice creams are amazing. We love this place.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,4/25/2020,"Came in for the first time recently and the cashier explained took her time to explain the drinks thoroughly. I ordered the rose milk latte, strawberry matcha latte and matcha coffee, all with 50% or 75% sweetness. The matcha flavor could be a little stronger, but other than that, the drinks matched its level of aesthetics. However, I had to wait around 15-20min for my drinks to be made. I visited this shop again for the second time but decided to order ahead via grubhub to make it more convenient. This time, I ordered the Thai tea and jasmine milk tea, both at 50% sweetness. Even with 50%, the drinks were extremely sweet so I recommend opting for less sweetness."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,4/2/2021,sooooooo good. i got a taro crush and it wasn't taro-y enough for me but it was delicious. i want to go back and try their ice cream and other drinks. they were super quick and friendly!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,3/1/2020,"Strawberry matcha latte with boba is AMAZING. Not too sweet at all, the only sweetener is from the purÃ©ed strawberry. Captain crunch milkshake was so so good."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/29/2018,"Came here during soft opening on a whim when I was in Chandler and I'm so happy I found this place on Yelp! The interior is akin to many tea places in LA, and the staff are so incredibly nice. The girl at the counter took time to explain the menu to us and seemed genuinely interested in their drinks. We ended up going with the rose milk tea and iced matcha latte. Both were sooo good. The rose milk tea is sweet and smells of naturally fragrant rose. It might be a little too sweet/syrupy for some though. The matcha was also absolutely perfect and didn't taste watered down at all. Their prices are competitive as of now, here's to hoping they don't increase significantly as they gain popularity. I'd totally come back here if I'm in the chandler area."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/22/2021,Delicious high quality drinks! Love them! They even had amazing hot coco bombs around Christmas time.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,4/21/2019,"Adorable little dessert place and heaven for those who are looking for cute backdrops for pics for Instagram while holding the most adorable and artistic looking drinks. I got the butterfly rose lemonade. It definitely looks better than it tastes, but it's worthy of a cute insta snap. They have tons of matcha options. Unfortunately, I'm not a matcha fan, but I would bring my matcha friends here to try some of their drinks. The staff is super friendly. She answered all my questions and offered me samples to try. She even wouldn't let me leave until I was completely satisfied with my drink ."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,6/23/2019,"Apparently they had to change their name to Rewind from Dripp, but this place was made to be Instagrammed with fitting backdrops and bright, colorful drinks for pictures. I'm sure there will be a Black Mirror episode next season about the culture of going to a restaurant or cafe for the 'gram, but I digress. All that aside...the ice cream and drinks are as beautiful on the inside as on the outside. I mean that quite literally with how they infuse the cereal into the ice cream. I was expecting something similar to Cold Stone where chunks of mix-ins are spread out in the ice cream, but they have a cool machine setup that drills your cereal choice down to distribute it homogeneously throughout the ice cream. I got vanilla ice cream with Cinnamon Toast Crunch mixed in and Reeses cups on the top. We all agreed the CTC was the perfect mix-in because when ground to a powder form you get a perfect flavor of cinnamon and sugar mixed in with the creamy ice cream. It also paired well with the Reeses on top. It definitely surpassed my expectations and it is a neat concept overall! My girlfriend got boba because when boba is presented as an option, she can not or will not choose anything else. She had an iced matcha latte with boba and I thought it was pretty good. The matcha flavor was very strong without being overpowering. My friend got a butterfly rose lemonade and it was tasty, the rose flavor was subtle. I personally would not order it because it was essentially more expensive lemonade with some subtle flavors, but if you are one to Instagram your drinks, the butterfly rose is a great model for photos."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,4/27/2019,So fresh and delicious for ice cream and matcha drinks! I am so excited to find this. So good to take kids and adults here especially in this hot Arizona weather. What a nice dessert place and it's under $10 for gourmet dessert with premium ingredients. The matcha tea here taste exactly what I had in Japan!!! I love it and definitely will return.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/24/2018,"Came through drippin' drip drip. Being a big boba tea aficionado, I was drawn to their drinks. Their strawberry matcha latte is absolutely incredible with homemade strawberry sauce and made on the spot matcha tea. It is reminiscent of The Boba Guys in SF. Their boba is just the right amount of chewiness, which can oftentimes be over cooked or made soggy. I've also tried their matcha latte which is equally as delicious! Their ice cream is quite the creative concept where breakfast cereal is melded into the soft serve. They have a plethora of cereals you can pick from to create a treat drawing memories from childhood. I will definitely be back soon!!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,10/9/2020,"I was looking to try some boba in the area, and I thought that I would stop by here. The store is clean and the workers are super friendly + knowledgeable! I had a sample of the strawberry jasmine tea, which was really delicious but way too sweet for me. I ordered a jasmine milk tea with boba at a level of 25% sugar. I was disappointed that they didn't offer 0% sugar, but I learned that the drinks were premade so they're unable to adjust the sweetness level below a certain threshold for certain drinks (I think the coffee drinks are the only ones that can be adjusted down to 0% sugar). Presumably because the milk tea was premade, my drink came out really fast! My drink was okay, I'm just not a fan of sugar in my tea, which is why I docked my review to 3 stars. I would rather go to another shop for boba, but I would come back to try the ice cream!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,5/16/2019,"Yummy ice cream for sure. I had the Oreo mix with a bit of chocolate drizzle and strawberries. I'm not a fan of cereal in my ice cream so opted out of that. They also have boba teas, and lemonades. This is a cute little ice cream spot. Return factor is high."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,4/13/2022,"I went into the Chandler location of this store with my daughter this morning, and I loved the energy of the store (the decorations were nice and the music choice was good) . I tried to order a vegan ice cream swirl because this store is one of the only vegan ice cream options in Chandler! However, there was a grown man taking my order, which I would not expect for a boba and ice cream shop, so I thought that was strange. The man struggled to communicate with us and made my daughter very uncomfortable. Other than that, there was a really nice young girl making our ice cream and she did a great job! Overall, I am confused as to why a grown man would be working at a boba store where the main customers are younger teens. It made my daughter and I feel very uncomfortable."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,7/8/2020,"Short Review: An odd boba shop to sum up. I will go more into details down below, but for this section, I'll just say their ice cream was delicious, the milk tea was good, and the inside of the shop is very sleek and clean and smells nice. Service was good too. Long Review: Rewind - Ice Cream + Boba Tea is a shop that specialize in dessert drinks and ice cream. But here is what's odd, they sell CEREAL! That's right, you heard me right, they offer breakfast cereal at a boba shop. I have never heard of such shop before until now. I honestly, don't know how it works, like do they just serve ordinary cereal where they just pour regular 2% or whole milk with retail bought cereal? I didn't ask because I'm not a cereal guy, but it would certainly be interesting if they offered milk tea boba cereal or something. Moving on, the inside has a nice beige cream overall interiors that makes it a pleasant sight to see. For menu, there are four categories: Teas, Ice Cream, Milk Shake, and Cereal. I got a Rose Milk Tea and Vanilla infused with matcha and almonds soft-serve ice cream. I don't care for cereal and while milk shake does sounds nice, I was more curious about their milk tea section at that time. It took about 3 minutes for my Rose Milk Tea and another 3 minute for my ice cream. Rose Milk Tea With Boba: I was intrigue by the gradient color layer of the drink. If that's their intention, then well done. It also taste fairly good for something that looked overly hyped. The taste reminds me of fruit loops cereal with lavender tea with milk and floral from the tea itself. When the drink is blended together, the color will change into light purple or lilac color. As for the boba, I was a little disappointed. The taste was good, but the chew was okay, but the worse part was the boba was stuck together into chunks. It was impossible to suck the rest of the boba even with boba straw. I'm guessing whoever cooked the boba, didn't stir it enough, and as a result, the boba get stuck together like that. Vanilla Soft-Serve Ice Cream With Matcha Infused + Almonds: At first, I was confused because I thought there were only two flavored ice, which was vanilla and chocolate, but I was wrong. You have two other steps which involved infused flavor and toppings for last. Any other extra will cost more, so keep that in mind. But anyway, this soft-serve ice was insanely good. As I eat this soft-serve ice cream over a hot summer season, my mind melted away. Such delicate, soft, smooth, and creamy consistency and texture. I was blown away at how good it was. And I have ate soft-serve in Disneyland, which was seriously good. Rewind, by far did the best soft-serve ice cream as far as I can tell. Although, the matcha infused was subtle, it still was a delightful treat that is hard to beat. Overall, I rate the quantity for milk tea/ice cream a B/A and in quality a -A/A+. Milk tea quantity is the same as many other boba shop. Price vs portion ratio are often the same. For ice cream, you get loads of ice cream at a great deal. For quality, Rose Milk Tea was great, but boba was terrible. Ice cream, by far, one of the best I've had, so it get an A+. It has a chance of reaching S rank, but the matcha was too subtle. If the matcha was a little stronger, I would give the ice cream an S rank. Otherwise, I gotta try their milk shake next time, now that I know their soft-serve is delicious."

https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,9/29/2020,"I saw a couple reviews that said they were out of the traditional black tapioca boba pearls when they went and unfortunately they were also out when I went today. They open at 11:30am and I had gotten there at noon. Seriously strange that a boba place would ""run out"" of boba pearls. I went with the ""crystal boba"" instead. Kind of disappointed. Tea was fine. For how large the drink was they were pretty stingy with the boba. If you're looking for traditional boba, I'd look elsewhere. If you want a super sweet mixed drink then this is your place. Prob won't be back."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,7/24/2019,"Needed ice cream on a hot humid monsoonal day. My lunch was underwhelming and I needed ice cream to soothe my soul. I found Rewind here and it was close, the menu looled interesting, so I drove on over. The parking lot was quite full as it was the lunch hour and people were going to eat their lunch. I walked in and was the only person having dessert! The young woman behind the counter was super friendly and nice. Answered all my questions and gave me suggestions. I ended up choosing the Minion on a cone. I mean who doesn't love Minions? When my cone was presented to me it was a work of art. A beautiful, delicious, work of art. I sat on the couch, relaxed, and enjoyed my ice cream. I cannot wait to come back!"

The staff is always friendly and the location is easy to get to.I love trendy places and the backdrop for photos is so cute. We went on Saturday to try their ice cream and I had the Reese's Puffs! I was so delicious and they topped it off very nicely with Marshmallow Charms. I will be back!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,1,6/6/2020,"All of the positive things I have to say about this place have to do with the branding and the service - the guy working was super nice and patient, waiting for us to make up our minds for what probably felt to him like forever. We were having so much trouble because the drink menu looked SO tempting. Eventually, we ordered: a cocoa puffs chocolate brownie ice cream monstrosity for him; a coconut milk/matcha drink for me, 20% sugar (yes, they allow you to choose your sugar percentage down to the percentage point. Awesome). So something really awful must have happened for me to give one star at this point, right? Yeah. The drink happened. The drink was just... terrible. Instead of using actual coconut milk, they used what tasted like an avalanche of artificial coconut flavor. Maybe there was actual coconut milk under there, but I honestly couldn't tell. It tasted like a Mounds bar. The matcha, layered on top, was visible, you know, visually, but taste-wise it may as well have been green water. Then, to top it off, the boba were like Aunt Jemima's ""maple"" corn syrup sweetness bombs. The combination was so repugnant that I failed to finish my drink even though it was 110 outside, I had just finished rock climbing, and I was parched. It just made me feel nauseous to sip it. We ended up going somewhere else to get cold drinks. The guy working did let me know that he would be willing to adjust my drink if I didn't like it - but there are no 'adjustments' that would have saved this drink beyond throwing it away and starting over."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,1,8/6/2021,This place took way to long to prep my order for my Postmates order. 15-20 waiting for prepping the order and when my Postmates delivery person arrived - it still was not ready. 3 Thai Teas - 1 with Boba - how long does that take to prepare?
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/29/2018,"Dripp it like it's hot! Dripp is the newest concept from the gang at Pokitrition but now they are serving up classic Boba and Cereal infused ice cream! Today was their Grand opening and people came out in droves. The wait was a bit but it was worth it. They offer Matcha direct from Japan, infused in several drinks as well as some other classics. I got the sweet Matcha and my husband got the Hojicha Latte. The sweetness from the whipped cream along with the Matcha was a perfect combination. The Hojicha was a nice taste since the Matcha was toasted. Their most expensive drink is the Coconut Matcha but that is because it is served in a coconut. So if you want a fun and refreshing aesthetic, hit it up! The ice cream, was absolutely delicious. You can create your own or they have 9 signature creations. Starts with a vanilla base, choose from one of 17 cereals to mix with the ice cream and last but not least, choose your toppings. We chose to do two of the signature ice creams. The cookies and cream along with the frooty tooty. The have a cool machine that blends at high speed, really helps to mix it all up. Overall, the Frooty Tooty was not only gorgeous but so tasty! The fruity combination with the strawberry syrup was delectable. Lastly, the cookies and cream was super creamy and adorable. Make sure to snap a picture against their adorable leafy wallpaper or the aesthetically pleasing neon light/boxwood combination. Tons of free parking, a decent size for seating and a great new addition to the area. Now you have an excuse to eat cereal for dessert."

Strawberry matcha is delicious as usual. The rose latte was something new I wanted to try. It was good but my only complaint is it wasn't sweet enough for me (75% sweet). It has a beautiful floral taste and the sweet element a was mostly concentrated in the pink layer. Still very yummy, just learned my lesson to make it a little sweeter next time since the rose flavor is very delicate."

I couldn't decide if I wanted boba, ice cream or the milkshakeC and the cashier offered me a sample of the lychee peachy green tea. The lychee peachy green tea was very refreshing so I got that, but they were out of boba and I had to settle for the crystal boba. (Saddest part lol) My boyfriend got the Reese's Puffs milkshake, and that was delicious. I immediately regretted not getting that too. Service is friendly. Seating area is clean."

My favorite is the honey bunches of oats with honey teddy graham. My boys love it all! This time I tried their matcha and it did not disappoint.

The butterfly lemonade is very pretty but make sure you mix the drink well or else the syrup is at the bottom."

It took me a while to decide what I wanted, but I ended up ordering the Ice Cream Swirl with Lucky Charms and Graham crumbs, which was delicious. I also tried a few other flavors, and those were all great as well. I think one order is more than enough to share between two people, so it is definitely worth it! The workers are all really kind and helpful. Since it was my first time there, they answered all of my questions. The interior was also really nice too, especially the wall with the greenery and neon lighting. Overall, I will definitely return whenever I'm in the area. I can't wait to try other flavors!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/2/2018,"Dripps is a trendy little ice cream and tea shop branching from Pokitrition. Ambiance: A faux greenery back wall flashes bright LED lettering ""Dripp it like it's hot."" Absolutely Instagram-worthy surely attracting millennials including myself. Customers stayed behind waiting to lick their ice cream cones so they can take the perfect picture with the cute backdrop. Within hours of opening, many, many people have already posted pictures on social media. I think they did a good job of promoting the new place so many people who are active on social media were aware of it. Grand Opening: The grand opening of Dripps was this past Saturday, September 29th. The place was open from 4 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. My friend and I didn't want to wait so long in line, so we came after dinner around 8:30. The line was still super long! So congrats, Dripps Co., on the successful new venture. Your soft serves and colorful teas are a hit! All items were BOGO and will be BOGO for the first week since opening. Soft Serve Ice Cream: 1. Cup or Cone (one size only) 2. Mix-In: All soft serves are vanilla only and you can choose your favorite childhood cereal including Lucky Charms, Cap'n Crunch, Frosted Flakes, Honey Bunches of Oats, Honey Nut Cheerios, Cookie Crisp, Froot Loops, and many more, that they will blend in with the vanilla soft serve. 3. Toppings: You can choose from a list of toppings they have. Most of them are more dry cereal but a few toppings I spotted are the usual froyo toppings like cookie dough and crushed oreos. You can pay 50 cents extra for other toppings from a list that includes fruit and other yummies. Cup of Soft Serve w/ One Topping: I ordered the soft serve in a cup mixed with one of my favorite super sugary childhood cereals, Cap'N Crunch. I topped it with cheesecake bites, my go-to topping at froyo places. The combination was amazing. The ice cream is so rich and creamy, the amount that they serve is just enough. The cereal mixed in was a little crunchy and grainy, but still so delicious. I highly recommend the soft serves. I think even just the plain soft serve would have been tasty! Teas + Coffee: They also serve matcha teas, rose milk teas, matcha coffees, and thai tea. You can add boba to it if you like. I still need to try these, but I have heard from the other customers, that they do not disappoint. My next visit, I would love to try either the rose milk or matcha coffee. Everything is aesthetically pleasing, I'm sure the taste matches the beauty of these drinks as well!"

https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/25/2021,"So happy to have found Rewind in my new neighborhood! The tea here is great! I've tried a few different drinks including lychee peach green tea, immuni-tea, butterfly rose lemonade (personal favorite) which have all been consistently delicious! I love the crystal boba!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,7/27/2020,They have good shakes and good Boba tea's and really friendly service. I like this place And so did my kids.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,8/28/2020,"Drinks are so beautiful and aesthetic! This is the perfect place to study if you could with friends. I got the butterfly strawberry lemonade and it was fruity and refreshing. Rose milk latte and pink crush were good as well, but I loooved the lemonade."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/13/2021,"gr8 thai tea, love that you could adjust the level of sweetness. very clean which is comforting, but also low staff which was no biggy. Katherine was bustin out drinks by herself during a mini rush which was pretty impressive"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/23/2019,"For some reason I kept thinking...""be kind, rewind!"" (SuperStar) when I seen the name of the store. Tonight we came for the ice cream and it didn't disappoint. My bf and shared the cookies and cream on a waffle cone-it had your regular cookies and cream ice cream topped with Cookie Crips cereal and Coco Puffs. I love chocolate soooo this was perfect all around. This place sets itself apart from others by incorporating childhood cereals and oh so great memories. Granted my parents never got us the Cookie Crips because they were ""full of sugar"". Look at me now! Lol I'd come back again to try the boba teas! I give extra stars to places that have backgrounds for pictures! Bonus!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,1,4/28/2021,"Don't send your child in alone. The girl behind the counter told our grandson the machine was broken so his kid cup was filled only one-third of the way (about 5 tablespoons) and watery, although he still paid full price and tipped. When he returned to the car he was obviously disappointed so I went in to ask about it. The shift manager told me that's how they come now and then added, ""Have a nice day."" I guess rudeness and minion size portions is how they roll! As for us, we walked over to Culliver's where my grandson got a real size cup of ice cream with great customer service!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,2/26/2020,"Went in today and tried the Butterfly Rose Lemonade! First of all, WOW so eye pleasing! I didn't even want to mix it because it was so pretty. But I did and first sip, WHOA!! So sweet. Too sweet for me to be honest. But they have so many other drinks that I really want to try. If you love sweet, BRL is for you!!! If youre a plain iced tea kind of person, you won't like this. Lol I did try a sample of the Peach Lychee Green Tea and that was great. I will probably get that next time!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,3/11/2021,"This place was excellent! The boba is high quality, and they give out samples for some of the tea flavors- which I really appreciate!! I got the brown sugar milk tea (dairy free) with boba and it was great. Staff was also very knowledgeable about the flavors offered and their caffeine context. They also have tons of unique flavors, my boyfriend got a captain crunch milkshake and it was really good and we've never had anything else like it! The shop was also very clean and cute, great vibe! Highly recommend as a dessert or boba!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,4/13/2020,Yummmm. Came here because of the dairy free option of coconut milk. Interesting concept with the milk and cereal. I stuck with the classic cookie dough on a cone with added chocolate chips and this little cone had sooo much doughy goodness in it. Will be returning.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/5/2018,"I'm lactose but I'll come back regardless :) The concept is awesome and the staff is always stellar. They serve delicious customizable cereal ice cream cones, bowls, milk shakes, or straight up cereal bowls. Can't go wrong with capn crunch or special k. Be sure to get a drink to go with your ice cream. My favorites are the matcha latte and hojicha latte."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,8/9/2019,I'd give them 4.5 stars. The workers are always super nice. The place is clean even when it's busy on a Friday night. I got the cookies and cream milkshake which was the right amount of sweet. Usually it's super sweet but there's just hit the sweet spot
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/19/2019,"This place was so awesome!! My sister & I were thinking of somewhere we could grab a dessert style drink or ice cream & this little gem popped up. It did not disappoint! My sister got the swirl ice cream in a cup with lucky charms cereal blended with the ice cream & lucky charms on top. I ordered the sweet matcha tea! Both were so delicious! I am typically not a fan of ice cream, but I have to say this was so good, I will definitely be back again! I highly recommend you stop in here and check it out for yourself. It's a very clean place and there are so many options when it comes to what you want. I want to try their strawberry cheesecake swirl next! Someone in front of us got it & it looked so good. The prices are fair, we paid just under $13 for both items, now thats a deal! Stop by & get your dripps on!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,2/13/2021,"Will definitely have to try Rewind again! I ordered the Matcha Americano and it hit the spot. Just a nice, refreshing drink where I could customize the sweetness. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Love, love, love that they are able to cater to vegans. There were four ice cream flavors. They also offered plant based milks. They do allow plant based milk subs for certain drinks at an additional cost. Tasted their blueberry cardamom ice cream which was delicious. Their cones and creations look amazing! Would definitely recommend trying."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,2/5/2019,"For boba drinks, it's only 3 stars worthy. The matcha tastes good, nothing amazing. The boba had a weird texture, seemed to be undercooked.. maybe if we tried the ice cream it would get better ratings. But I wouldn't recommend it for boba. Very aesthetic but not so tasty. We're boba fiends seeing as we have our own straws. BYOS!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,9/16/2018,"Dripps has been on my radar since I saw their sign up. They are coming in hot with a new trend a giant drill that mixes in a cereal with an ice cream base. If it sounds crazy it IS and you have to see it yourself! Since it was soft opening some items weren't available. I really enjoyed the fruity pebbles mix-in with ice cream we got. Not only aesthetically pleasing but had the right amount of sweetness. Only thing was off today my ice cream was melting too fast. Get your hands on that Hoji-cha latte! If your into roasted tea like me you'll like the smokey flavor. They also have matcha lattes for matcha lovers and drilled ice cream shakes. The decor is spot on for the gram. Cute tropical prints, yummy on-trend desserts and friendly staff! Thanks Dripps!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,7/25/2019,"Vegan friendly! Some of us can't eat regular ice cream as lactose bothers tummy. They offer lactose free ice cream and they are very good. Drinks they make here is so pretty, I originally found this place via Instagram as so many people posts yummy looking drinks online. Service is very good. Friendly and efficient. Now I learned their menu, if my lactose intolerance person wants ice cream, I know where to go."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,11/14/2018,"We stopped by on a Friday night 40 minutes before their closing time, and the line was still pretty long! The menu is up on the wall so we had enough time to look it over and see what we wanted. The decor is super cute inside, and the lighting is perfect for some great pictures! They do have limited seating and they have a few tables outside as well. We were lucky to find us a little corner to sit down at, as everything else was already occupied. It was dirty though and had ice cream all over. We ended up ordering one Thai tea with boba and a vanilla cone with fruity pebbles and sprinkles. Our total was close to about $12.. Yikes, a little too high in my opinion.... The cashier was beyond friendly and he got us through quickly! We sat down and waited for our treats. The ice cream was pretty good and it was very creamy. We enjoyed the Thai tea (it was nothing special) and the boba was perfectly made. It was the right amount of chewyyyyyy! *It can get pretty expensive especially if there are a lot of ppl in your group. We don't have that big of a sweet tooth, so we ended up sharing our ice cream cone between three people. I can't imagine how much it would've been if we had all ordered one... Do come though cause it's pretty neat inside and a bunch of their other drinks look really cool and tasty! I will be back again to try those out."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,1,4/1/2022,"Definitely not good for kids. Very offensive music playing. I don't think Yelp would let me repeat the lyrics in a review so how is it okay to assault our ears with that shit. It belongs in the club, or at home. I wouldn't take my family here again. My daughter didn't even like her icecream. It was mushy and dripping and she loves almost all icecream. Avoid!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,3/14/2019,"We were in town for the Aloha Fest and as usual, I was craving something to satisfy my sweet tooth. So of course, I had to do to my search on Yelp and low and behold, it led me right here. What made this place even more enticing is the fact that it was just around the corner from where we were staying. Now what initially drew me to this place is the fact that they serve cereal infused ice cream. I thought ""that's different, let's give it a try."" They have many different cereals which includes many childhood favorites like Lucky Charms, Cookie Crisp, and Frosted Flakes. Trying to figure out our own mix was a bit overwelming so we all decided to go with something from their signature ice cream menu. The ice cream itself was creamy and definitely hit the spot. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered with the exception of the big teenager. He got the Cookies n Cream and wasn't too happy about it. He said it was too milky and didn't have enough ""cookie taste"" to it. But besides him, everyone else enjoyed their ice cream (me included). I went with the Thunder Buddies and the Teddy Grahams just gave a nice extra touch to it. But as many other yelpers stated previously, their creations are definitely instagram picture worthy, especially with their decorated wall. So make sure you take a minute or so and snap that picture."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/20/2019,"This place was delightful. Yet unexpected. I've never had cereal ice cream before, but this place is near my house and right by Pokitrition.... so I had to try it out. I let my 11yo order for both of us. We had a cinnamon toast crunch milkshake, and a cookie dough milk shake. I had no idea what to expect, and was very pleasantly surprised. Both were fantastic!!! A little on the pricey side, but worth it for an occasional treat. We'll be back for sure"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,8/9/2019,"First time was tonight after dinner and the place was super cute!! Very simple and clean, such friendly staffs and great service! I ordered an ice cream swirl in a cup and it came out way better than I thought, the way it got mixed together with one choice of your mix, PERFECT Would come back again, they have my business! Next time I'll try out the beautiful drinks, it's nice how they used canvases with photos of their drinks as advertisement."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,5/13/2019,Perfect for the Arizona heat. Saw this place on social media and knew I wanted to try this place out when I visited. The specialty drill infused ice cream was a real treat and the you can't go wrong with the drinks here either. *Strawberry Shortcake Ice Cream Super nostalgic! Definitely an upgraded taste to the strawberry shortcake ice cream bars from my childhood. The strawberries and cream cheese taste mend together really well. The ice cream has hints of graham cracker and the flavors are well incorporated with one another. *Strawberry Matcha Latte Very pretty before mixing and letting the flavors get to know each other. The matcha flavor is really rich here and the strawberry jam adds a good amount of sweetness to the drink. *Rose Milk Latte I really liked this one since it had a mellow flavor. The rose hints blends nicely with the tea. The normal adjustments are just enough where the sweetness doesn't overpower all the other flavors.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,11/20/2019,"One of the things that is conspicuously absent from the area around my neighborhood is a place to get ice cream. The Dairy Queen and Cold Stone in our area are a little too far away for us to conveniently just go out to get an ice cream. So I was glad to see this place open up essentially across the street from us and I had to give it a try. I discovered that Rewind is yet another restaurant that was apparently inspired by Christina Tosi and her Milk Bar in New York. I ordered a Lychee Matcha and an Ice Cream Swirl with Cookie Crisp cereal and Reese's Cups. This location appeared to be fairly popular, although it was still relatively new when I visited. The service was great and the quality of the items I ordered was very good. The only downside is that it's a bit pricey for it to be a just a neighborhood ice cream shop. Rewind is probably better suited for a high end strip mall or an indoor mall. Good place to bring a date if you want to impress them, though."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/17/2018,"There's a saying now that we eat with our eyes and this place is a prime example of picture perfect dessert. Not only the dessert is well put together, the interior as well. Now there's a big trend going on with grassy walls with neon signs and there's one implemented here to show off your dessert! These places are definitely a reminder that we're slowly started to get all the ""Cali-like"" boba/ ice cream places. Phoenix is really needing more places like this and I'm very happy it's in a prime spot. They're located next to Pokitrition, near off the 101 and Ray. The cool thing is that the creators of Pokitrition also made this place too! I didn't get to try the boba just yet but the ice cream is great. While being one of the reasons I don't have a 6 pack yet, this just makes it worse cause I'd probably be craving this place. KITH Treats is also a place that I get reminded of about this concept. This place is going to blow up and be packed. I'll be back for more. CERTIFIED BANGER"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,7/4/2021,Loved it super refreshing! For my strawberry matcha I would probably ask for it less sweet next time
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,4/20/2019,"Very cute shop, extremely instagram friendly with the green plant wall and neon sign. Super cute decor and couches, everything was spotless! The menu was a little confusing. I decided to do the standard combination because I didn't know what to choose based on my own combo. They have a lot of cereal topping options and the consistency is great! It is much better than cold stone creamery. It's around $7 for a cone or milkshake. They also have boba and fresh matcha tea. I'll have to try that next time. The strawberry shortcake was definitely my favorite, they placed fresh slices of strawberry on the side with sprinkled cinnamon crunch on top. It was a good size, almost too big to finish. The cone tasted very good. Definitely worth checking out if you're interested in mix-in style ic cream"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,11/11/2019,"My first time coming here and I like it! Little cute shop and they have cream infused ice cream serving premium matcha sourced straight from Japan featuring layered drinks plus boba, but optional. If you grew up and loved cereals and now you're tired eating cereals or simply because you don't have time to eat in the morning for breakfast and you have a favorite childhood cereals, this is the place to go! They have cereal shakes such as Fruity Pebbles, Cinnamon Toast Crunch or Oreos mixed together with super premium 16% butter fat ice cream and topped off with one of these choices like graham cracker crumbs, gummy bears, chocolate or caramel drizzle and teddy grahams. I ordered their brown sugar milk tea with boba and matcha latte. The price is right for the size, I wished they could put more matcha on my latte. The boba is a bit firm, but it works. Their other desserts look delicious too and I will come back to try their other yummy items in their menu."

Rose Tea Fact: Rose tea has several beneficial effects including boosting the immune system, treating a sore throat, boosting your digestive health, and has high levels of antioxidants and vitamin C. So drink it! I've been seeing my girl Lien S. checking in here and I have been meaning to drop in for a while but I never seem to be in this area. And with the owners of Pokitrition being the mastermind behind Dripps, how could I not? And now that I've have their Rose Milk Latte, I'm hooked! Matcha Coffee, Hojicha Latte = Meh! Coconut Matcha, Sweet Matcha, Strawberry Matcha = Yes! Rose Milk Latte = Yaaas!!! I haven't tried much of their ice cream selection besides the Caramel Apple since it's cold both outside and in my heart but they look good. Dripps also offers a soy milk option for their drinks too so rejoice! I'll be back again and again for that Rose Milk Latte. Pea flower tea? Sign me up!"

Got there just right before they closed, a little expensive for 3 drinks and ice cream in a cup. Drinks weren't all that great, even the ice cream didn't taste good. Waste of my money, I would say bcz didn't even drink half of my drink before I decided to toss it in the trash!"

I had ordered the iced matcha latte, which was perfectly made the way I like it (you can definitely taste the matcha, but it's not too overpowered by the sweetness of the sugar and milk). The cereal milk ice cream was also delicious. I almost forgot to take a picture, since it looked so good."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,6/13/2019,Thunder buddies was delicious! Ice cream had a great consistency and was not overly sweet. Would love to come back and try others when I'm in the area.

One of the employees helped us out by explaining the menu and helping us pick our options. My husband ended up getting one of their signature ones, cookies and cream. I ended up making my own shake with fruity pebbles. I loved the variety and how I could make my ice cream the way I wanted."

LA Ktown native traveling south to AZ for vacation with family and who would've thought there would be a dessert gem in this desert! At first glance, the store looks really clean and decorated moderate and appropriate. Alot of cute areas for photo ops(IG Worthy), sit down, relax and study. Being a first timer, the staff there were super friendly when explaining their concept of blending ice cream and treats. Strawberry Shortcake: if Cold Stones was the ice cream mixing giant of the 2000's... Dripps is the ice cream mixing innovators of the future.. seriously. The ice cream was soft and creamy and the flavor profiles of the extra mix ins were delightedly recognizable yet worked well to compliment each other. I really enjoyed all the other extra candy toppings that i got to choose. This treat was just that: A TREAT! Also try the Thunder Buddies! My nephew got it and i loved how well the Reese's blended well with the ice cream! I will definitely be back for more on my next AZ trip, thanks for the awesome visit Dripps!"

https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,3/27/2019,"This was an awesome experience, a little more than I'd like to spend on milkshakes but definitely a cool experience and I highly recommend doing it at least once, the staff was great the facilities were clean. I will say seating is limited so it can get crowded."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,6/28/2020,"Fun little shop, & friendly service. I've tried both the lychee & peach green tea, and mango black tea; both were delicious. FYI- The butterfly rose lemonade literally taste like a rose so if you're not a fan of your drinks tasting like a flower, then you may not like this one in particular. I cannot eat dairy so I have yet to try their dairy based drinks, however they did tell me that they can substitute with almond or coconut. I will be returning to try out more. :)"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,1,10/15/2018,"If you want to pay $7 for a scoop of crunchy vanilla ice cream, then this place might be for you. I was utterly baffled by the concept of this place, but curiosity got the better of me. In hindsight, the $4.50 ""bowl of cereal with milk"" should have been a major red flag. While the first layer of caramel and brownies that topped my creation were admittedly rather tasty, the crunchy mess below was immensely unsatisfying. I'm pretty confused by other reviews pointing out ample parking and ""competitive pricing,"" which were not my experience at all."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,10/27/2018,"After seeing other yelpers checking in at this place, we figured we would give this place a try on a Friday night. For ice cream, it is all vanilla base. Then you pick a flavor, a topping and an ingredients and they will create one just for you. You have a choice of having it on a waffle cone or a cup. I picked the waffle cone (and I regret it later because it was too much and messy). They also sell unique drinks that I would like to try next time. Since it was my first time, I ordered one from premade menu (I think it was called Oreo something). It took them at least 15 minutes to make the ice cream, but we did not mind to wait since it was a Friday night. If you want to go in and out of there, just keep that in mind. I also tried a sip of the Strawberry Macha Latte. It has a unique taste to it, but I am not sure if I would order it for me. Overall, the service was friendly, prices are a bit high but once again I love local businesses. I will come back to try something else again"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,8/22/2019,Delicious milkshakes. I had my reservations about a place using prepackaged cereal as a main ingredient in the majority of their dishes. But I was wrong. They. Are. Delicious. I also really enjoy watching the assembly process.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,5/8/2021,Loved it! Perfect for a late night treat! Highly recommend trying out their special shakes
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,12/23/2018,"Went here a few weeks ago. We were there later in the evening and there was basically no line. My worldview was completely changed by fruity pebbles in my ice cream! We also got the Apple Jax milkshake...it was good, more of a large ice cream as opposed to a milkshake. Only reason for 4 stars was it took a while to get our order."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,11/9/2018,"We had the Thunder Buddies and the Minion's Treat. Substituted banana for cheesecake on the minion's treat. The treats were delicious, the ambience was modern and hip. I'll definitely be coming back. By far the best ice cream in this part of the valley. My only mild complaint is that I wish they were a little more diligent about wiping down the tables. Go here for instagram-worthy ice cream!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,8/30/2019,"This place is easy to get to, is clean and the staff are nice. I had the Matcha with Strawberry puree and it was so delicious. I thought it would be too sweet and not enough matcha but it was perfect! My friend got the pink crush and that was really good too! Will be back here again"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,5/14/2019,"This place is super creative for having cereal-infused ice cream, and it was super delicious too! The shop environment was really Instagram-worthy and the people working were extremely friendly and I got my order within a few minutes. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for dessert that has different textures, perfect for summer!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,2/5/2019,"What friendly service! Walked in looking for a caffeine kick and was immediately greeted with a smile and info about what they served. Fun, little place with a hip atmosphere. Drink was hand delivered to me and oh my goodness....so delicious."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,10/6/2018,"Pretty novel idea - mixing in fave breakfast cereals with ice cream - so it has a very familiar taste since they all have a vanilla ice cream base but is in that sweet treat realm. I had the Minion in shake form which was Frosted Flakes, banana and chocolate syrup all mixed together, which was pretty good. My son had a shake and had just Crunch Berries mixed in. On the plus side, it was a shake with Crunch Berries, on the downside, it was just vanilla ice cream, milk and Crunch Berries.... a little too close to just eating some breakfast cereal with milk. Good-ish but not great for the $5 I paid for it. If you go, choose one of their concoctions, you will definitely need a little more added to it than just cereal or it's gonna fall a little flat."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,1,11/9/2018,"I probably would have given a 3 star, but my 2 visits left a bitter aftertaste. On my first visit it was really packed. So I couldn't ask about pricing or how ordering worked. My sister and I thought the ice cream was good, but really heavy and sweet. The service was fast, but not really friendly since it felt like they were in training mode and I felt really rushed. The cashier making my order also forgot I ordered a second ice cream. So I had to remind her. On top of that, I kept getting weird looks that I couldn't decipher... maybe annoyed. Plus, she also forgot my extra topping, which is 50 cents extra. I had to remind her yet again. It was a really meager amount too. She also got chocolate drizzle all over the sides of the cup, but she kind of quickly wiped it down when she was instructed to. But I still got chocolate all over my hands. The ice cream was also really expensive for how small the portion size was. I paid about $16 for the two ice creams and the extra topping on both. So it ended up being around $6ish for each. I had no idea what the pricing would be until after I ordered because the price wasn't listed for the signature items on their wall menu. The cashier also didn't give me a receipt until I asked, so I had no idea what I paid since I missed what the total was due to the choatic environment. On a side note, when paying, you swipe for debit and insert chip for credit. The cashier didn't explain this. So my card wouldn't go through when I chose debit and inserted my card.. She didn't bother explaining why my card wouldn't go through. So I just ended up guessing and tried swiping. My card finally went through. They really need to take the time to communicate no matter how busy it is. It left a bad impression. I decided to give it another try the next day since I was in the area. I didn't know what time they opened, so I ended up coming too early and waited close to 30 minutes. When I entered, I heard the cashier kind of groan or make some sound similiar to a groan. I felt unwelcomed, but I ignored it since I waited 30 minutes since my sister really wanted a drink. I ended up getting two drinks: the Matcha Coffee and the Strawberry Matcha Latte. The cashier for this second visit also did not tell me about the payment process. She chose credit for me, and I inserted my card since I remembered the other day that I chose debit and needed to swipe. This was annoying because if I had a card without a chip, and I tried swiping after she chose credit for me my card wouldn't have gone through. Anyway, the coffee drink for the price definitely wasn't worth it. They add plain cane sugar for the coffee. For the price, I was hoping for honey or a higher quality sweetener. But the strawberry latte was good. It just needed more strawberry syrup. Although how they make the drinks seem inconsistent. I was watching the drink making process, and the cashier was using two different brands of almond milk because it must have ran out. Anyway, my sister noticed that her almond milk was low quality and tasted bad before she mixed her latte. I didn't even tell her that it was low quality milk, until after she told me her observation. They used Great Value almond milk in her drink, while they used Simple Truth in mine. For the price, they should use a good brand of milk substitute. The cheap stuff tends to taste bad. She liked the matcha though. She thought it might have been a high quality matcha. I have to agree on that. I ended up googling them since I was curious about the reviews because my overall experience was pretty bad. When browsing the pictures, I noticed that our ice cream was definitely much smaller and it was more of a heavy concrete texture compared to the light swirls in the pictures. I took the ice creams togo. So I guess they cut the size down to get the lid on. They should have told me I would get more than 50% less ice cream if I got a lid. They need to get bigger lids or something. Although what angered me was that in the pictures, the Cookies and Cream ice cream had Cocoa Puffs and Cookie Crisps. However, my ice cream definitely did not have any of those toppings. When I ate it the day before, I just assumed they blended it into my ice cream. Lastly, the Minion's Treat was either missing the almonds or it was such a skimpy amount that I couldn't see it or taste it. The ice creams in the pictures had a decent amount of toppings for the exact ice creams we got. I don't know why we barely had any toppings and some of our toppings were missing. We are lactose intolerant. This was supposed to be a rare treat worth the stomach pains and other problems. The only nice thing about the experience was that the owner/manager/trainer or whatever her position is seemed nice. She told the girl making my order to wipe the chocolate drizzle off the sides of my cup because she was about to hand it to me without wiping it. She also got me a togo menu when I asked for one."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,3/11/2021,"They're nice and helpful here. They'll give you lots of time while suggestions while ordering. Their menu is really limited for a boba shop, no taro which is a bummer. I wish their menu was bigger but what they do have is good!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,10/28/2018,"I had high hopes for this place. When I first entered it was really clean and service folks were really nice. I ended up grabbing the strawberry shortcake (one size only). When I was rung up I thought it was a mistake but it was over $7 (seemed expensive). Once they made my order I dove right in. The fresh fruit was nice and the ice cream it self had a mix of graham crackers inside which gave it a unique crunch. While it tasted ok, I wasn't super impressed and given the price I was less than thrilled. Don't think I'll be returning."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,12/10/2019,"Let's start off with the positives. Rewind has a really trendy interior aesthetic, and I think their employees are really polite and efficient. However, that's where the pros end. I don't think this place is bad- I just think it's extremely mediocre. Drinks are passable, but very sugary and basic. The desserts are even more generic. There is literally an item on the menu that is straight-up cereal and milk. If this place was super cheap I would be more understanding, but its actually pretty expensive for what you're getting. Overall, not horrible? I would recommend this for a first date, I guess."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,12/30/2020,"Found this place thru an Arizona based foodie account. I am a matcha fanatic and I ordered the matcha ice cream. The quality is fantastic, but if the owner ever reads this- substitute the chocolate pocky sticks for matcha ones!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,8/20/2020,We love this place. They got great boba and you can also adjust the sugar level to your liking. Ice cream looks delicious might try it next time. But definitely recommend the Thai tea boba :)
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,12/30/2020,"Great ice cream I got the matcha tea I cream but two issues: #1 came a with chocolate pocky sticks instead of matcha. #2 greatly expensive, I bought 2 for $16. Definitely not a great deal. But at the end of the day they at least deserve 4 stars because I was impressed with the taste."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,7/18/2019,Fairly average milk tea place for my taste. Some of the drink flavors seemed off from what you'd expect.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,6/7/2019,"My brother took us here & I gotta say..... one of the best boba places here in AZ. There's one closer to where we're staying for our summer vacay, but we drove out a little just for this place!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,8/8/2020,Best boba in AZ! So yummy and tapioca is always fresh and chewy! I recommend the brown sugar milk tea or the strawberry matcha latte! Both are so delicious!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,3/24/2019,Walking into dripps I instantly felt refreshed. The space is bright and vibrant. It's small but just big enough to seat a moderate amount of ice cream eaters. Dripps produces Instagram worthy treats that are catered to cereal addicts. But the don't only have cereal as a topping. You can easily choose from several different candy bars or melty drizzles. There is something for everyone. I ordered a milkshake. Not just any milk shake but a snickers crushed and infused melody of crunchy vanilla goodness. It was delish. My bf ordered a sundae with Capitain crunch and my mom ordered a surprisingly delicious vanilla cone chucked full of strawberry flavor and snicker dust on top (copy cat). We all enjoyed our treats and sat at a cute table near the window. This place gets busy pretty quick but the line seems to move rather quickly. I don't enjoy giving Reviews that are under 5 stars if I enjoyed my experience at a restaurant or establishment. In fact it's annoying to see someone give a rave review under a 4 star rating. *rolls eyes* I'm giving 4 stars because although I enjoyed my experience I was pretty shocked to see how small the ice cream cup was that my bf received. It literally looked like a kids serving. And that in itself costs $6. My milkshake was huge and the cone was huge. I looked around and saw others with larger servings as well. Maybe they messed up the order? Idk. I'll be back again but I don't suggest ordering a cup of ice cream. Get a milkshake or cone.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,10/29/2018,"I went here the other day with my sister and I was surprised by how unique the flavors were! The place itself was designed really nicely and they even offer an aesthetic backdrop for your boba drinks and ice cream. I got the matcha & strawberry with boba and it was so good, it was a little sweet so the next time I come back I'm probably going to have to lessen the sweetness, and my sister got a rose milk tea latte with boba, which was also surprisingly good. Not only were the drinks delicious, but the service was extremely good and the workers were very friendly! Overall, it's definitely a place worth checking out."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,3/18/2019,"I like this place due to great location, amazing nice employees, and interior wise is nice relaxed place. Good place to hang out."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,7/3/2019,This place is delicious! I love their cereal based soft serve. It is breakfast as desert and each bite turns me into a small child again. I have tried a few of their drinks and most have an ingredient I don't like such as matcha or Jasmin but my friends who are not against floral as a beverage love their drinks.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/18/2018,"I forgot to post my review on this spot a few weeks ago but wanted to go back to it since it was a fun place experience. Mostly really into the decor of this spot, if your looking to go somewhere cute and trendy for pics. But I also really liked their boba tea and they have some really unique options to choose from. I'll be back to try their ice cream soon...looked amazing too!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/21/2019,"My boyfriend and I tried this place and it was pretty good! You get to choose what kind of cereal or ingredients get blending into your ice cream or milkshake & then what cereal, candy or other toppings go on top! Good place to go if you're craving ice cream or just something sweet"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,6/21/2019,First time here and won't be the last. Thank you to the friendly staff. The strawberry cheesecake was rich but not overly sweet. The graham crackers on the ice cream stayed crunchy till the last bite! Both of the matcha drinks were fantastic!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,11/3/2020,"I took my son and his bestie here for a quick treat. Really loved it. The drinks are as refreshing as they are pretty, and the staff is very friendly!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,2/24/2019,The rose milk latte was delicious and pretty to look at. The matcha coconut was refreshing without being too sweet the boba was chewy and fresh. Will go again. A little bit of a long wait but I think that is because they were cutting open a coconut. The ice cream looked delicious as well different options. Small menu but since each drink is hand crafted the taste is superb and doesn't need a big menu to compensate.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,10/31/2019,"I liked it, but there are a lot of other ice cream places I'd rather go. Yes, there is a uniqueness with the creation process and some of the different mix-ins, but it only satisfied my craving for ice cream. The ice cream didn't speak to me and I like it when my ice cream speaks to me."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/9/2018,"Yum-mmy!!!! Me and my husband stopped in here and ordered ice cream. After we placed our orders we were chatting with the girl that took our order about the other items they make. I first off have to say that I absolutely LOVE matcha! It's a great natural source of caffeine as well as a rich source of antioxidants. She asked if we have heard of matcha, I simply said yes but definitely went into my matcha connoisseur mode. She pointed out photos of fresh drinks they make and some including matcha. She proceeds with telling us that they get their matcha directly shipped in from Japan! Which made me ecstatic!! Back to reviewing our order, I got the Strawberry Shortcake and my husband the Cookies & Cream which were both lovely to look at, delicious and super filling. We'll be back for sure for dessert but I'll be back asap to try their matcha drinks!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,6/3/2019,"Got the rose milk latte, which was delicious. I'm glad this place started serving boba! We got a small, I believe, for ~$5. Tables were sort of filthy, so we had to wipe them down ourselves before sitting, but I believe there was only one person working behind the counter at the time, and he was understandably very busy with orders by himself. The flavors are pretty unique, so I'd go again!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,5/3/2020,"My friend and I found this place on a whim, and we are so glad we stopped by. Many people come here for ice cream, but you have got to try the drinks as well. I love the Strawberry Matcha Latte, and all the coffee drinks."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,10/1/2018,"I visited the day after their grand opening and it was still super packed, but worth it for their soft serve with their cinnamon toast mixed in and cheesecake bites on top. I just wish there was more cheesecake bites on top. I also got their rose milk and was slightly disappointed because there just wasn't enough rose for me. However, I will definitely be back to try other drinks and to get more soft serve. The space could be considered small, but has a super photogenic leafy wall for photos. It was also super nice of them to continue their BOGO deal for the week a total steal!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,11/3/2018,Around the chandler area this evening and saw this on yelp. Saw that they had matcha and I LOVE matcha from back in Cali. The matcha coffee was perfect after a big meal. Please open one out in the west valley! We need more stuff like this!!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/6/2019,Love the vibe! Got the Jasmine Milk tea & loved it. Great choice of music. Will definitely come back.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/26/2019,I have been wanting to try this place for a few months and today I finally made it in. So happy I did. I had a small scoop of the matcha ice cream with fruity pebbles mixed in and it was DELICIOUS. I didn't get her name but the sweet young lady that helped me was very knowledgeable and suggested I get the matcha coffee. She was even kind enough to Google items that we were unsure had gluten in it. I really appreciated her assistance and I will definitely go back again! Oh yeah and I got two matcha coffees. One for the ride home to Sahuarita and one for tmrw morning.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,2/21/2020,This is very high quality and tastes super good! You can get super creative with the flavors and mix-ins. I'll be coming back many more times!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/15/2020,I work across the street and tried rewind for the first time today! I am in love with it. The girl in the front was the sweetest! I definitely will be going back!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,11/21/2020,Our first time here and we loved it! My husband had a plain vanilla on a waffle cone and I had Bourbon Caramel which was to die for delicious! Not too sweet and the ice cream was so creamy. The prices were so reasonable for such great quality. Both staff members were very friendly. We will be back!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,10/24/2020,"For the cost and quality of ingredients, I'd say this place is mediocre. They are stingy with the matcha (soft serve and mixed drinks) so the flavor is very subtle and overpowered by the sugar/dairy. I got the Matcha Americano and it was very watered down. It's probably one of the better options for matcha you'll get in Phoenix, but does not compare to places you'd find in California such as Cafe Matcha Maiko."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,11/26/2018,"With all the hype over cereal mixed into ice cream at Dripps, my family had to give them a try. We ordered the Strawberry Shortcake cereal infused ice cream cone, a strawberry matcha latte & the rose milk latte. The Strawberry Shortcake was captain crunch cereal, cheesecake & strawberries mixed into vanilla ice cream and topped with graham crackers & strawberry sauce. The ice cream mix was good, sweeter with the cereal & add ins. The strawberry matcha latte had strawberry purÃ©e on the bottom, then milk layer and topped with matcha. The rose milk latte has rose syrup on the bottom, milk layer in the middle and topped with blue butterfly pea flower tea. Both drinks were good but similar to what other boba places are serving nowadays. I would recommend the cereal infused ice cream cone over the drinks because it is more unique in flavor."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/8/2019,"Omg!! You need this place in your life especially vegans!! Vegan ice cream was amazing, plus you get to add your own toppings! So so good always trying to do dairy free and I will definitely be here every other week. Soo good"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,5/27/2019,"Delicious! Sometimes the wait is pretty long if there are a lot of people in line, but people in line means they have a great product!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,1/13/2019,"Delicious and unique ice cream/drinks. I don't think the ice cream is worth the seven bucks though UNLESS the person making it puts in the effort into make it aesthetically pleasing. Because come one, that's what most people go in there for. One visit my ice cream cone looked squashed and lopsided, the next it was tall and proud with strawberry syrup that I didn't receive on my first strawberry shortcake cone. I'd take an out of town person here to show that AZ does have some cool spots, but I wouldn't come here on the regular. *side note- no substitutions on the signature combos. This includes simply omitting a topping due to allergies."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/2/2019,I first came here during their grand opening when the line was so long that it snaked out of their store. I did not regret the wait at all as the their ice cream and boba did not disappoint. I ordered their rose milk tea both times I visited which is both visually pleasing and tastes really good! I also ordered their famous cereal ice cream both times I visited which even had my mom impressed who wasn't planning to eat any of the ice cream. The worker at the counter was very nice and gave our family good recommendations from the menu as well as samples. She tried her best to accommodate to our needs and our orders came out pretty fast. I plan to visit again soon! The atmosphere of the place as well as their location is nice as well.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,1,10/19/2018,I was excited to try this new ice cream shop since it's walking distance from my house. They mix cereals into their ice cream. I wasn't too interested in trying that but did have cookies and cream mixed in with a little chocolate syrup as a topping. The ice cream is sickening sweet - I couldn't finish it. Worst ice cream I've ever eaten. They are expensive also. They weren't busy on a Friday night - now I know why.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/5/2020,Amazing milkshake and great service. I will definitely be back to this local place. This was my first time
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,1/30/2019,"After seeing this place pop up on my yelp, I thought id give it a try since we were in the area. We went on a Sunday afternoon so there was no waiting and we were able to order right away. My husband ordered the Thai tea and I ordered the vanilla soft serve infused with fruity pebbles topped with circus animal cookies. You can order from one of their pre made menu or create your own. They offer a variety of ingredients you can infuse into your ice cream. The way the mix the ingredients into the ice cream makes it taste so good. I got mine in a cup so I can share with my little one or you can order your ice cream on a waffle cone. They also offer drinks & teas if you're not in the mood for some ice cream. Definitely come try this place out :)"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,12/19/2020,AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! Such unique flavors that blew me away. Highly recommend! The workers are incredibly sweet and nice.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/7/2020,Manager reached out letting me know that the issue had been resolved so that it would not happen again. I've been back several times since and it has been great every time.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,12/31/2018,Very cute location! Very aesthetic. They have ice cream and boba options. Seemed a little pricey for what the ice cream was - $6 for vanilla soft serve blended with a cereal and 1 topping. I had Cinnamon Toast Crunch with honey drizzle. It comes in a cup or cone at no additional cost.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,5/6/2019,"A very great ice cream place, the portion is hugeeeee! Love the different variety they give, mixed with numerous selections of cereals. The rose milk tea was pretty good, definitely would recommend for the ice cream lovers to come and try! Ice cream definitely tasted very balanced. Not too sweet not too bland!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,2/25/2019,Ice cream was a little too sweet for us. The boba was just ok too! Nice store but probably wouldn't go here all the time for dessert.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,4/14/2019,Love Dripps! Such a unique concept to mix cereal in with the ice cream. Every flavor I have tried has been delicious. My favorite is the Reese Puffs mixed in with Butterfinger topping. Such a yummy treat!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,12/26/2018,"I was here over Christmas day, it was nice and quiet. The backdrop and neon lights is key to be deemed an IG destination as you do a quick photo sesh to make those likes and comments rain. I had the sweet matcha drink while my friends ordered the strawberry cheesecake soft serve and the rose milk tea. I was able to try their orders and I liked it all. I would definitely come back here."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,11/10/2018,Great environment and friendly staff. It was my first time here and they walked me through what I could do and then what their favorite was. Will deff be back again!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,1/6/2019,"I found this place on Instagram and was in awe. It was closer to my boyfriends house than it was mine so I took a screen shot of the name and knew when I went down there we'd have to try it. Yesterday we so happened to pass it on our way home. Although it was a gloomy raining cold day I said I HAVE TO TRY IT. I was impressed. I did mix in fruit loops and he even told me that was a bad idea, yet somehow couldn't keep his spoon out of my cup. It was absolutely phenomenal, and I love soft serve. This is better because you get to mix in what you want and the soft serve is very creamy and thicker than others I've had. Only downside is it's a bit pricey for (~$7) for a small (cup) of ice cream. Worth it and will go back!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,7/10/2020,"The best milk tea shop love that they have milk alternatives. Top Drinks in my opinion, Iced Matcha w coconut milk or Rose Milk tea w Almond milk"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,10/7/2019,"I would have to say that I'm not a huge fan of their matcha drinks, but I did enjoy their Matcha Soft Serve. I think it might be because there was so much milk I couldn't really taste the matcha. But, I mentioned I did like the soft serve. It was incredibly rich in flavor and wasn't super sweet, which was perfect. I got it the chocolate dipped cone topped with gold flakes and chocolate shavings. And believe it or not, the chocolate complimented the matcha very well. The shop overall was super cute and aesthetic so it's definitely photogenic. It's quite close to my house so I'd probably come back if I had a sweet craving."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,2,3/24/2019,I found your place yesterday and got an ice cream swirl. Then I insisted on coming back the next day with my adult daughter and boyfriend. I bought another ice cream swirl. Daughter and boyfriend ordered a milkshake and a ice cream swirl in a cup. Both of my cones were pure perfection. My daughter enjoyed the flavor is her milkshake but thought it was thin. Her boyfriend got a swirl that looked like it was in a child's cup. I saw other customer receive their orders and get larger portions and large containers. I didn't say anything until we left when he said he enjoyed his ice cream but it was too small of a serving for $6+. I was alarmed to hear that he had not ordered your one scoop serving. Very disappointing! Update: they are allowing the bf to get another serving on their dime. Thank you for making it right.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,3/9/2019,"My boyfriend and I wanted to check this place out for awhile now, but the location is so far from where we live. The inside of this place is so cute and clean, definitely insta worthy. What I ordered was a cone mixed in with cinnamon toast crunch, topped with cheesecake bites. Costed roughly around $6. I've read yelp reviews about ice cream being costly, but lemme tell ya, it was so much ice cream, I couldn't even reach the cone!! It was so good and my tummy was so happy, but full at the same time. This ice cream cone could definitely be shared with others. My boyfriend got a milk shake with apple jacks mixed in. They also topped the milkshake with the cereal as well. My boyfriend enjoyed it a lot, he finished the whole thing. We will definitely be back soon and can't wait to try their teas."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,7/24/2020,This place is extremely cute. Very aesthetic with a wall that I've seen a ton of people take pictures at. The ice cream is also great! A little overpriced for the cones but yummy nevertheless. The boba was also delicious (it was sweet and soft). Thai tea is my go-to and they can customize the sweetness levels.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,10/7/2018,"This place was having a bogo special, so I was definitely interested in checking it out. My friend and I got the rose milk tea and the presentation was nice. It was in three layers: pink, white, and baby blue. You can also get it with boba. You're encouraged to stir it so all of the layers will mix. It was really good! Lastly, this place has really nice wallpaper and a wall of leaves for a good Instagram moment. Next time I go, I will try the ice cream. It looks like everyone around me got an ice cream and seemed to enjoy it."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,10/31/2018,Awesome ice cream concept! They mix in your favorite breakfast cereal to vanilla ice cream to make new flavors. The texture is a little different but still overall a great dessert! I tried the caramel apple and it was amazing!! All the flavors blended really well and the cheesecake pieces were an awesome addition. I recommend going back to try every combination! I think I'll get the cinnamon toast crunch next!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,12/1/2018,"DRIPPS is my answered prayer and biggest blessing to the Chandler area this year. I'm not kidding when I say I come here at least once a week. When they first opened in September, it was even more than that, taking advantage of their soft opening and grand opening discount and BOGO. They are an awesome company, from the owners over at Pokitrition. The star here is CEREAL INFUSED SOFT SERVE. And no, it is not just some cereal just sprinkled into the ice cream. It is generous amounts of cereal of your choice literally DRILLED in and it is the best cereal ice cream in the world. I am a huge fan of Christina Tosi's Milkbar cereal ice cream, but Dripps takes it to a whole other level. I can assure you your favorite childhood cereal is among their choices. They do have signature creations you could choose from and mix and match toppings, but what I love to do is just choose a cereal and use the same cereal as topping. Their ""supporting actor"" I would say is their matcha drinks. If you love matcha, you will be in heaven. They use real QUALITY matcha. Great flavor, good caffeine kick without the jitters. Next favorite is the rose milk tea. It's not too ""flowery"" it is more milky which I love. Their milk teas are good as well. The only one negative thing is the boba balls are not as soft as I would love them to be but I enjoy milk teas without boba so they get a pass. The whole concept is just amazing and I'll shout it from the rooftops if I could. I LOVE DRIPPS!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,4/5/2019,Love this local spot and love its sister company pokitrition. I think it's amazing they have a coconut based ice cream that is just as delicious!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,2/2/2019,"I love Dripps, they have great customer service. The staff is friendly and helpful. The ice cream is amazing, the cereal is not soggy at all."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,10/9/2018,"More of these modern dessert places are popping up and it makes Arizona more fun! I got an ice cream cone that was ""infused"" with Cinnamon Toast Crunch and strawberries as a topping. I thought it was enjoyable, but there were some cereal parts that were oddly chewy, like they've gone stale. The place looks very comfortable and it has cute, modern decor that you can take pictures with. Either the marble table, the palm leave wallpaper, the grey walls, or the ""succulent"" wall that has a glowing sign which reads, ""Drip it like it's hot."" It's a cute place and it has some creative ice cream flavors. My cousin got a matcha drink and the matcha is very high grade, but we both thought it was very heavy on the matcha."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,3/29/2019,"I the ice cream , great Coustumer services ,clean place, LOVE LOVE There matcha te definitely coming back , friendly environment ."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,2/15/2020,I have been to this place a few times. They have ice cream infused with cereal or milk tea drinks. The cereal-infused ice cream is a pretty neat concept. I don't think I have been to another dessert shop that does this. They definitely give you a lot of toppings. This is a great place for meeting up with friends after a meal and we just want something light to snack on and catch up. The drinks in my opinion weren't as great as other places. I ordered the jasmine milk tea which was a little light compared to other boba shops. However I really love matcha and will have to try their matcha drinks next time.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,3/10/2019,"Tatum walks up before we leave and says ""you have the best ice cream!"" Yummy and unique. Def going back and coming from Scottsdale, I must say it's worth the drive. Get it!!! Greg #myfitmortgage"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/31/2018,"I recently moved to the area, and as a passionate foodie, was looking for a new boba/ice cream shop to feed my cravings! Search no further! The decor is beautiful, and the staff were friendly; they gave some recommendations of their popular drinks, and they also do seasonal ones too! I decided to go with the Rose Milk Tea which has hints of floral notes; absolutely refreshing and not too sweet. My friend created his own ice cream with toppings, but don't worry, they've got popular creations of their own if you can't make up your mind. Overall, a great quality dessert place, and I will definitely be back!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,8/2/2019,"We got the cookie monster special which is the blue ice cream with mini cookies and oreo crumbs, and a cone with fruity pebbles mixed in and topped with marshmellow charms. The marshmallow charms were stale. The blue ice cream was noticeably less cold than the vanilla ice cream and had a paste like consistancy, but the cookie monster tasted good."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,9/7/2019,"My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday around 3pm and we expected a long line of people. To our surprise, it was just us and 2 other people. The inside was clean and well kept except for the couch they have. We figured a lot of people like to sit on that couch so there's some ice cream stains on it. It was our first time here and the menu is very self explanatory so it's easy to order what you want. The service was great, we enjoyed our ice cream and milkshake. Would definitely recommend to a friend!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,12/15/2020,Great menu with a great selection! I ordered ice cream and a rose milk latte and both were phenomenal! Staff were super nice and helpful! The orders came out so fast
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/10/2020,Best Boba I've ever had. I'm a hardcore Boba fanatic. Really surprised as to the price. Wouldn't mind paying $2 more per cup to be honest.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/19/2019,My sister found this place on yelp and it looked like an awesome place to check out.OMG was I right!!They greeted us as we entered including anyone who entered and lemme tell ya this place got rather busy quick even though when we walked in there was only a couple people before us!Now I can see why! So many options regarding topping wise and mix in I loved it and the fact that they had all kinds of cereal options for you the mix in was amazing.I ended up getting a mix in swirl which consisted of a vanilla base ice cream and my choice of mix was lucky charms which they grinder into the ice cream yes!And I got a choice topping as well and I went with the marshmallow charms omg SOOOO GOOD! My sis ended up getting a matcha milk tea of some sort with boba! Hands down best ice cream place I've been to so far! Most def a place to go and check out if you're in the mood for some ice cream or drinks!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,12/9/2018,"Absolutely amazing. Flavor combos are unreal ... if you like classic cereals, you have to visit this place!!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,2,10/30/2018,"Great customer service, I ordered a Oreo flavor cone today. Everything seems alright until I finished half way and found a tissue inside my ice cream, I think I have swallowed a few pieces..I thought it was oatmeal at first........"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/7/2018,"This place is soo good super cute, highly recommend the Cookie Crisp ice cream. It was very cheap as well which I was surprised. I will definitely be back to try different flavors :-)"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/2/2018,SO GOOD!!! Been here 3 times already and love it. Wasn't sure if ice cream and cereal would be a great combo but it is excellent! Never had an issue with staff or service even when they are busy. Will definitely be back :)
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,3/26/2021,This place is BOMB! My husband and I LOVE all their milkshakes. Definitely has turned into one of our go to sweets joint. Perfection!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,9/13/2020,Super cool place. So many dairy free options and a very nice staff! I would highly recommend it!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,9/25/2019,"I think the options are limited here and that limits the business model. This is a rewind business but lacks universal appeal. While cereal and ice cream appeal to some, the business needs to offer more variety for people who do not want more sugar coated cereal in their ice cream, especially at $5.95 for 2 scoops. A customer's glance does not highlight any unique ice cream flavors or any special process in preparation. No one spoke to us as a group of four and no one offered any advice or samples. To be honest, if you're going to sell ice cream you still need to highlight the ice cream."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,11/3/2018,Wow! Came in not expecting much else besides ice cream but they add cereal into it and it makes a WORLD of a difference. My order: strawberry shortcake Reminds me of the ice cream bar back in the day! Definitely coming back to try all the other signatures!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,2/8/2020,"I looooOVe the matcha and thai tea with boba here!! The texture of the boba is always perfect. The fruity pebble infused ice cream is my fav for ice cream! Love the cute instagram-able and family friendly interior, and customer service is always so awesome!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/10/2018,Just had the strawberry short cake ice cream and my wife had the one with bananas and teddy graham crackers and both were really good! Thanks to Keith for recommending this place that his friend owns!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/9/2018,YUMMM!!!! I can't wait to try all of the different flavors! This place is a must try!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,11/7/2018,"Came here for the first time and ordered the butterfly rose lemonade, it's really good. I'll come back again!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,1/26/2019,"Very instagram-able interior, and the menu is easy to understand. I looove cereal but this takes it to a whole new level! My favorite is the Cap'n Crunch milkshake."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,12/17/2019,"The ice cream is good and plentiful. The mix concept is different and the mixer is kinda cool to watch. The teas were decent and definitely pretty. Overall, it's a good spot and if I'm in the area again, I'd get an ice cream and a Tea to go."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,11/24/2018,"Rose milk latte! It taste delicious, must try! We got there on the second day after grand opening and they were so kind to give us a discount as we missed their grand opening day :)"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,7/27/2019,"Such a unique concept, yet so simple. Cereal infused ice cream. My mouth is watering just thinking about how good this ice cream is. They even have a dairy free option which my daughter took advantage of. Would definitely recommend this joint to everyone and plan to go back in the near future."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/2/2018,It was the best ice-cream. My daughter loved it as well. We will be back soon. Don't forget to order macha coco together with your ice-cream. It was perfect match.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,11/25/2018,"Excellent, fresh ice cream with many eclectic toppings (and a drill to make room for them in the ice cream!) make Dripps a great place to go for dessert or a tasty treat. The iced Matcha green tea latte is absolutely delicious and a great way to get some antioxidants. Took one star off for the smaller space and time to wait for order. Otherwise, the food, drinks & service is top notch!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,4/28/2019,Love this place! We come here on the regular. Their ice cream is delicious (strawberry shortcake is my fave) and their jasmine milk tea is pretty good too. A HUGE plus that they also have a non-dairy option.
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,4,12/7/2018,Very good ice cream and friendly management. Great place. They were very helpful in getting thing together to celebrate our grandson's birthday. Had a great time!
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,5,10/10/2018,"Wonderful new addition to the area. I thought it would be just another ice cream place, but I was pleasantly surprised to learn differently. This was my first experience with Matcha. The employees have answered all my questions and take excellent care of me. I feel welcome each time I come in with a hello and focused attention. Definitely a new favorite of mine!"
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,1,10/4/2019,"I've been here a few times and the tea is pretty good. We are currently here and it has been over 30 minutes and we are still waiting for our tea. There is only one person working and he continues to take orders even though he was backed up. Probably won't come here again. On a personal note, we didn't care for the music either."
https://www.yelp.com/biz/rewind-ice-cream-boba-tea-chandler-3,3,1/4/2020,Kinda pricey and my one order took 15 minutes. Think I'll just go to Culver's next time
